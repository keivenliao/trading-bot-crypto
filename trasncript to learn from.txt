00:00:00.819 hey everyone thanks for checking out my
00:00:03.050 course on trading all coins and
00:00:04.370 cryptocurrencies before we get into the
00:00:08.960 course itself I wanted to take a bit of
00:00:11.210 time to explain Who I am and where I
00:00:14.090 come from and my walk of life and why
00:00:16.430 this course was created so I never
00:00:20.690 thought I'd be a day trader I actually
00:00:22.820 went to university for nine years to
00:00:24.859 become an architect so I have a master's
00:00:27.800 in architecture I have a Bachelor of
00:00:31.099 Fine Arts in new media engineering so I
00:00:33.920 have a computer science background as
00:00:35.929 well as an architecture background so
00:00:37.870 day-trading was not something I had
00:00:41.149 intended doing I think the lure of day
00:00:43.549 trading came to me when when I was in
00:00:48.709 university I played poker online to pay
00:00:52.190 for my tuition and the thing that I
00:00:56.659 loved about poker was the analytical
00:00:58.339 side of things
00:00:58.999 it was the analyzing of hands and cards
00:01:01.129 and the challenge of beating somebody
00:01:05.390 else on the other other side of the
00:01:07.700 cards there you have your own whole
00:01:09.740 cards and and the idea of playing and
00:01:12.380 beating somebody else is very alluring
00:01:13.609 to me right kind of that gamers
00:01:15.469 mentality a very competitive nature so
00:01:19.070 from there I I ended up not playing
00:01:23.210 poker
00:01:23.719 because Black Friday happened and for
00:01:25.700 those of you who don't know Black Friday
00:01:27.140 happened I believe it was back in
00:01:28.700 November of 2011 the FBI or whichever
00:01:33.920 authorities was that shut down all the
00:01:36.439 poker sites basically seized the online
00:01:39.710 poker so all the poker sites were seized
00:01:41.780 therefore lots of us who are playing
00:01:43.490 poker were forced to move on some of us
00:01:47.060 moved on to playing poker at a different
00:01:49.039 scale and some of us dropped the game
00:01:50.600 completely I was one of the people that
00:01:52.759 dropped the game completely for me it
00:01:55.039 was time to move on I was in university
00:01:57.259 anyways you know I was many years into
00:01:59.829 my studies of becoming an architect you
00:02:02.829 know becoming an architect and getting a
00:02:05.030 master's in architecture is a pretty
00:02:06.590 pretty long adventure so my walk of life
00:02:09.530 was never intend
00:02:11.030 to become a day trader and the reason
00:02:12.770 I'm saying this is because I know a lot
00:02:13.970 of people day trading is either
00:02:16.130 something they want to get into or
00:02:17.960 something that's new to them or
00:02:20.210 something they quite haven't been able
00:02:22.310 to say I'm in one profession but I want
00:02:25.310 to make a switch to another maybe I'm in
00:02:27.890 sales or maybe I'm an architect or maybe
00:02:30.440 I'm an engineer or maybe I'm in
00:02:32.660 financing or maybe I work at McDonald's
00:02:34.340 it doesn't matter what walk of life
00:02:36.350 you're from if you have an interest in
00:02:38.750 day trading this is a course for you and
00:02:40.940 this is this is a good starting point so
00:02:44.480 that that's a bit about me myself and
00:02:50.110 and and where I come into day trading
00:02:52.910 now why did I create this course and why
00:02:56.120 did I want to take on this venture to to
00:02:59.630 train other people I spent many years
00:03:04.120 learning how to trade I spent many
00:03:06.820 thousands of dollars buying books
00:03:09.320 reading materials the student did me you
00:03:12.320 know naturally after nine years of
00:03:13.820 university you kind of get this this
00:03:15.470 knack for reading material and going
00:03:17.030 through material and and chewing through
00:03:19.040 knowledge and you go on this path of
00:03:21.410 wanting to consume as much as you can
00:03:23.060 and learn as much as you can so for me
00:03:25.970 it was you know thousands of dollars in
00:03:27.980 years of training and books and studying
00:03:30.110 and the refining of skills things I've
00:03:32.870 learned along the way
00:03:33.670 like discipline from poker and analytics
00:03:37.150 math being able to to read situations
00:03:41.000 and analyze things in great depth so
00:03:45.610 I've seen it all my life
00:03:47.390 kind of people they want to learn how to
00:03:49.549 trade and they go through this process
00:03:51.680 of starting and failing and trying and
00:03:54.950 failing and trying and succeeding and
00:03:56.720 then succeeding and failing and it
00:03:58.280 becomes this rollercoaster of what what
00:04:02.480 do i what am i doing right what am i
00:04:03.980 doing wrong and it's it's it's a tough
00:04:07.190 thing to make a career out of day
00:04:08.630 trading is not an easy thing to make a
00:04:10.160 career a tough because it takes a lot of
00:04:11.480 time a lot of effort a lot of study and
00:04:13.489 I have a real problem with the material
00:04:17.690 that's out there in the world to train
00:04:20.329 traders you know I often see online
00:04:23.349 on online in person I meet traders all
00:04:27.800 the time I you know I've attended
00:04:30.020 seminars I've done the whole night and I
00:04:32.569 I always see the same kind of hook and
00:04:35.300 spiel as they say you know learn my
00:04:39.169 strategy it's it's done me so well and
00:04:42.020 I've taught tens of thousands of people
00:04:43.849 to make millions of dollars with this
00:04:46.099 strategy but really it's all kind of
00:04:50.409 it's it's not real it's somebody trying
00:04:54.680 to if somebody were making millions and
00:04:57.050 millions of dollars trading they
00:04:58.550 wouldn't share their secrets to the
00:04:59.810 world they wouldn't expose all these
00:05:02.629 these great forms and tactics that they
00:05:05.599 use to make all this great money so a
00:05:07.099 lot of it is and I've seen this for many
00:05:10.639 years five six seven years now people I
00:05:13.310 know when they go and they spend five
00:05:15.050 and ten thousand dollars on training
00:05:16.879 courses online or they they they they
00:05:19.879 sign up for these mentorships from
00:05:21.979 people who promised to give them this
00:05:24.379 great method some fibonacci pivot method
00:05:27.199 that was created by somebody else or
00:05:29.389 some some reshape of material that's
00:05:33.500 that's already accessible out there or
00:05:35.810 one specific strategy when really day
00:05:37.819 trading is very specific to a set of
00:05:41.840 fundamentals you know you can you guys
00:05:44.449 can study these on your own time I won't
00:05:46.430 dive into them because I could spend
00:05:47.840 hours talking about them but there's Dow
00:05:49.759 Theory there's week off theory and
00:05:51.289 there's there some things that I'm gonna
00:05:53.210 be breaking down throughout this course
00:05:55.009 and giving you guys kind of the
00:05:59.180 takeaways from it because you can spend
00:06:00.620 years reading about the stuff and
00:06:02.539 learning about this stuff but the the
00:06:04.250 takeaways are the important parts and
00:06:06.949 I'm not saying don't go learn about them
00:06:09.110 I'm saying you use my years of knowledge
00:06:12.169 and experience and and my many years of
00:06:14.870 reading to kind of streamline some of
00:06:17.120 this material for you and and don't
00:06:18.949 become a victim to the trap of buying
00:06:22.069 training materials for thousands of
00:06:24.229 dollars in signing up for these courses
00:06:27.819 that really are just the reshaping and
00:06:31.759 the rehashing of other material and
00:06:33.740 something that may or may not have
00:06:35.060 worked for somebody there
00:06:36.350 there is no set strategies there's
00:06:38.240 there's a right way to trade and there's
00:06:39.500 a wrong way to trade now there's
00:06:41.990 strategies at work of course there's
00:06:43.790 always going to be strategies that work
00:06:44.930 in trading but you can't build a career
00:06:47.900 off trading so that's that's a bit about
00:06:50.690 why I created this course and who I am
00:06:54.560 and kind of if this is for you or not so
00:07:00.200 this is going to be the fundamentals now
00:07:01.820 this is going to be the first part of
00:07:03.920 the course and this is mainly going to
00:07:05.240 be focused on just going over a few
00:07:07.520 basic concepts that I want people to
00:07:09.350 really understand grasp and make sure
00:07:14.960 you guys are applying these things
00:07:15.980 before we get into charting and
00:07:18.530 technical analysis and you know how real
00:07:20.750 supports are created and what it means
00:07:22.490 the gain support versus losing support
00:07:24.230 and what it means when you fail to gain
00:07:26.720 a high and and how how that effects a
00:07:29.600 move and before we get into that there
00:07:31.730 there's a set of foundation that I need
00:07:34.160 everybody to follow and understand
00:07:38.180 so to start who is this course for
00:07:40.730 beginners if you're a beginner in day
00:07:42.110 trading no problem this is going to
00:07:44.270 create a great foundation as this course
00:07:46.520 is created it's created hierarchically
00:07:48.070 as two beginners course first we're
00:07:52.010 going to go through all that material
00:07:52.670 that I'm going to get into more advanced
00:07:54.200 and then I'm going to get into the
00:07:55.550 really heavy deep stuff so it's going to
00:07:57.290 go on a chronological order
00:07:58.520 where beginners are going to be able to
00:08:01.250 follow from from the very first course
00:08:03.590 all the way to the end there's about I
00:08:07.720 think the list is up to 44 different
00:08:10.340 videos now of things I'm going to be
00:08:11.990 talking about and I won't get into what
00:08:13.280 they are right now with the exception of
00:08:15.260 they are 44 different topics so each
00:08:18.200 video will you know you'll probably want
00:08:20.450 to watch it a few times study it
00:08:21.650 understand it ask questions yadda yadda
00:08:24.350 etc pros if you're a pro if you're
00:08:27.020 already day trading it's gonna help you
00:08:29.420 refine their skills it's going to help
00:08:30.710 you properly identify levels entries
00:08:32.840 this that everything else this is not
00:08:35.330 just for beginners it is very advanced
00:08:37.159 knowledge as we go it is it is
00:08:40.840 everything I know on trading and I've
00:08:43.760 been day trading for a long time very
00:08:46.000 successfully so
00:08:48.410 and and I focus mostly on on
00:08:50.209 cryptocurrencies and and and
00:08:52.940 specifically all coins Bitcoin III do
00:08:55.279 trade Bitcoin as well but I have a
00:08:57.110 passion and a lot for trading all coins
00:08:58.579 so that's that's really who this who
00:09:02.839 this would be targeted towards there's
00:09:04.970 people who love trading cryptocurrencies
00:09:06.910 but but day traders in general this is
00:09:09.829 this is theories of knowledge that is
00:09:12.730 usable and applicable across every
00:09:16.730 market because trading is not specific
00:09:18.319 to one market or another okay the
00:09:20.930 fundamentals of trading getting started
00:09:23.420 on the very basics of trading the idea
00:09:27.439 and again this is this is only to bring
00:09:31.639 ideas to your guys mind so that you
00:09:33.709 understand this is some of the stuff
00:09:35.509 we're going to be talking about but I
00:09:36.680 yeah but I want everybody to focus on a
00:09:38.959 couple key key theories I guess it would
00:09:44.209 be before we get into lesson two three
00:09:46.790 four or five so the fundamentals of
00:09:48.560 trading accumulation distribution in
00:09:50.930 trading there there is periods there was
00:09:55.730 a period of accumulation which people
00:09:57.620 are buying a coin with a target in mind
00:10:00.709 right so that's before a price we move
00:10:03.170 up people are accumulating the coin
00:10:04.670 right or accumulating the stock or the
00:10:06.529 asset or the
00:10:07.880 the wealth or whatever you want to refer
00:10:11.000 to it as there's an accumulation period
00:10:12.589 a distribution period right and a
00:10:16.750 another accumulation in a distribution
00:10:19.370 so accumulation and distribution are our
00:10:22.519 targets of each other right I'm gonna go
00:10:25.279 to this here gonna look at a trade and
00:10:32.680 we'll get into that a bit later but just
00:10:35.750 to briefly go over accumulation and
00:10:39.589 distribution the idea of accumulation
00:10:42.980 and distribution is simple this ends up
00:10:45.649 being an accumulation zone now why is
00:10:47.420 this an accumulation zone right here
00:10:48.769 this is an accumulation zone because
00:10:50.809 people are looking to buy here for
00:10:53.269 whatever reason with a target of selling
00:10:56.029 either here or here right so
00:11:00.410 accumulation and distribution becomes
00:11:02.150 the theory of accumulating a coin with
00:11:04.910 the idea and I'm just gonna refer to it
00:11:06.350 as a coin meu asset pool a stock bitcoin
00:11:11.480 whatever you want to call it I'm just
00:11:12.680 gonna refer to it as a coin
00:11:14.290 okay so accumulation people are buying
00:11:17.300 in this level with the idea of selling
00:11:19.760 here or here they have a target in mind
00:11:22.460 so this is what's called the
00:11:23.630 accumulation period so after a coin
00:11:25.640 distributes you you enter accumulation
00:11:28.070 and when an acquaintance accumulates
00:11:29.660 people are doing that for distribution
00:11:31.340 purposes okay so if you were to jump
00:11:33.830 into this trade right here and we're
00:11:35.600 gonna keep this very basic for now this
00:11:37.310 would be an accumulation period when
00:11:39.140 you're buying here you have a target
00:11:40.730 you're saying I have a distribution
00:11:42.770 target of maybe here because of some
00:11:46.280 level in the past maybe this was the
00:11:47.660 level right now that would be a level
00:11:49.310 but just just you know for quick
00:11:51.590 reference I'm buying in this area here
00:11:56.060 because I know this level is going to be
00:11:58.070 tested and I'm going to distribute at
00:12:00.290 that level now in this case this move
00:12:02.720 wasn't done this was the accumulation
00:12:04.820 down here right and I'm gonna mark
00:12:06.800 accumulation as yellow for this purpose
00:12:08.720 and distribution is red so I need to
00:12:12.170 back it up few more steps here right so
00:12:15.580 accumulation is yellow distribution is
00:12:17.990 going to be red so we distribute here
00:12:20.720 oops we distribute here right
00:12:25.820 we re accumulate that's not what I want
00:12:28.400 to do we react Yuma late in the short
00:12:31.520 right here right and then we
00:12:35.780 redistribute right here so this is the
00:12:39.110 idea of accumulation and distribution
00:12:41.210 every stock goes through this cycle of
00:12:43.940 accumulation and distribution and what
00:12:45.530 happens after accumulation distribution
00:12:47.420 and what happens after distribution
00:12:48.800 accumulation so it's a cycle right you
00:12:51.260 have moves accumulation and distribution
00:12:53.330 so that's the third piece of this is the
00:12:56.390 move right so in purple I'm going to
00:12:59.960 show the move
00:13:06.199 okay good
00:13:09.050 right this is a doubt this is oh there
00:13:13.529 we go this is the move down right this
00:13:16.709 is the move up right accumulation move
00:13:19.529 up distribution move down accumulation
00:13:23.970 with up distribution move down this
00:13:28.889 would be accumulation right here right
00:13:34.850 you move up
00:13:41.500 this would be distribution so
00:13:43.450 distribution of accumulation has periods
00:13:45.370 and phases it goes into when something
00:13:47.800 is accumulating it people are
00:13:49.840 accumulating a coin for a reason they're
00:13:51.310 accumulating a coin because they have a
00:13:52.540 target now in this case you know we're
00:13:54.610 just going to draw just just just
00:13:56.350 quickly some levels that I'm noticing
00:13:57.520 that would be a level let's go to the
00:14:02.500 weekly here to see maybe there's a clear
00:14:05.230 identification of wells I know I'm just
00:14:07.240 doing this on the fly to see where the
00:14:08.620 levels are that would be a level right
00:14:10.930 there right so not getting too much into
00:14:13.540 why these are levels but because this is
00:14:15.190 a swing high on the weekly that was a
00:14:17.560 weekly target so you know ultimately
00:14:20.020 this move ending here would have been
00:14:22.420 trying to fix it on a weekly target so
00:14:26.290 accumulation and distribution the idea
00:14:29.260 of buying a coin and and and why moves
00:14:36.070 happen and why they exist okay so that's
00:14:39.520 accumulation and distribution okay
00:14:44.620 trends accumulation and distribution
00:14:47.860 just just to finalize on that
00:14:49.140 accumulation and distribution we will go
00:14:52.120 over that in depth but just for now I
00:14:54.160 want everybody to realize that this is a
00:14:56.380 very important theory to understand in
00:14:59.530 all trading so whenever you guys look at
00:15:01.120 treats get into the habit of identifying
00:15:03.490 accumulation and distribution periods
00:15:05.260 because accumulation has a target which
00:15:07.660 is distribution accumulation has a move
00:15:10.060 which is a move up into distribution
00:15:11.940 distribution then has a target of riah
00:15:14.230 cumulation right I'm gonna leave it at
00:15:17.410 that before it gets you know to advance
00:15:19.450 and we have to start going into
00:15:20.470 different things trends trends is
00:15:22.690 another very important thing in in in
00:15:25.300 trading in day trading and in stock
00:15:27.370 trading and trends the idea of a trend
00:15:31.150 is this back up the idea of a trend is
00:15:37.060 is some some reason or a pattern that
00:15:39.850 something happens for for a reason a
00:15:43.030 price moves either in a parabolic motion
00:15:45.670 and parabolic meaning like a mirror so
00:15:47.530 it has a down move followed by an up
00:15:49.720 move or or it has a valley that's
00:15:51.550 created some type of trend
00:15:54.440 now this was iota recently in a trade
00:15:57.319 that I made and I Otis trend here was
00:16:01.930 this swing hi don't let's go to the
00:16:06.139 4-hour level and do this actually it's
00:16:07.759 more more relevant on the 4-hour level
00:16:11.600 this swing high to this swing high here
00:16:14.029 created a trend okay so now in this
00:16:16.459 trend the reason why trends are so
00:16:18.649 important is because it kind of dictates
00:16:20.029 the entirety of the move you know in
00:16:22.490 this in this trend here we have this
00:16:24.829 starting here and you can see this kind
00:16:26.420 of motion where it comes up to test
00:16:27.860 trend comes down it comes back up
00:16:29.959 bounces off comes back up here bounces
00:16:33.139 again here comes here does this tries to
00:16:35.149 break it and you'll notice something
00:16:37.009 interesting when this trend breaks it
00:16:38.509 actually tests a moving average level
00:16:40.910 this is an MA level so if I were to turn
00:16:44.000 this off this is that the moving average
00:16:46.910 on on a 26 day period now we'll get and
00:16:49.069 we'll get into that later but the idea
00:16:52.189 of this trend is that it is in this move
00:16:56.870 and it's testing trend right so you can
00:16:59.029 see this whole pattern here is a trend
00:17:02.720 right you can see this whole pattern
00:17:05.750 here ends up becoming this trend right
00:17:08.209 and becoming a squeeze or a trend or
00:17:10.250 something that gets respected between
00:17:12.260 levels until for one reason or another
00:17:13.880 it breaks out up or down it breaks a
00:17:16.939 trend it does this it is odd you know
00:17:18.169 people know them as wedges ascending
00:17:19.640 descending wedges both legs bear flags
00:17:22.220 whatever you want to call them the idea
00:17:23.839 is that trends are a huge cornerstone of
00:17:27.409 trading and it gets very advanced right
00:17:32.330 trends trends become not just let's draw
00:17:34.909 a wedge and see what happens there's
00:17:36.200 there's a reason why everything happens
00:17:38.809 at a trend all the way up from every
00:17:40.820 touch and what it means when you you get
00:17:42.740 a wick that breaks through a trend to
00:17:44.059 touch an MA and how many times it does
00:17:46.159 it the first time it does it you know
00:17:47.630 they call that first touch the second
00:17:49.220 time it does it it calls it it's called
00:17:50.690 first test so there's a reason why
00:17:52.130 something happens on a first touch
00:17:53.450 versus a first test versus a second test
00:17:56.360 so you know without getting too deep
00:17:58.309 into trends trends are for the purpose
00:18:01.850 of the the first video here trends are
00:18:05.410 another cornerstone of your foundation
00:18:08.780 of trading next one being levels the
00:18:12.170 fundamentals of trading another thing
00:18:13.550 that you know the three fundamentals in
00:18:15.170 my opinion accumulation and distribution
00:18:16.880 trans and levels and levels we're not
00:18:19.430 going to get into at all other than they
00:18:20.900 are support and resistance and everybody
00:18:22.520 knows what that is and I'm going to have
00:18:24.800 probably about five or six different
00:18:27.950 videos on on levels all the way from
00:18:32.960 beginner levels to advanced levels is
00:18:37.040 one of those things that get it
00:18:38.270 it gets so deep every everything from
00:18:43.910 how many times a level gets touched if
00:18:45.860 it's the first time if it's a second
00:18:47.840 time what it means if a level gets
00:18:49.820 wikked one is it gained and lost what it
00:18:52.190 means the gain support versus losing
00:18:54.110 support you can have a level right you
00:18:58.280 can have let's simplify this let's take
00:19:04.130 that away let's take that away and and
00:19:07.970 just to quickly go over this for for
00:19:09.560 those of you who are a little more
00:19:10.700 advanced and you know kind of kind of
00:19:12.890 won an understanding of what this is
00:19:14.240 going to be about let's just call this
00:19:18.140 level
00:19:19.120 the swing high we're just going to call
00:19:21.650 this resistance for simplicity sake for
00:19:23.930 now even though it has different reasons
00:19:26.630 for for everything right and this would
00:19:29.420 be the bottom channel of that level
00:19:30.680 right there's a reason you know why this
00:19:33.830 happens here which would be considered
00:19:36.190 first touch and you know going forward
00:19:41.000 in this move what what does that mean
00:19:43.040 for the rest of the move when it
00:19:44.750 establishes first touch what does that
00:19:46.370 mean for first test right so when this
00:19:48.800 comes up to test this for the first time
00:19:50.360 what does that mean right same with this
00:19:52.400 think creating first touch here you know
00:19:54.740 just just to give you guys a piece of
00:19:56.650 trading advice here a first touch like
00:20:03.140 this is going to get rejected 90% of the
00:20:05.090 time so often in trading you're going to
00:20:06.890 see a level established followed by
00:20:09.200 first touch right and then this here
00:20:11.060 followed by first touch and first test
00:20:13.100 and so on and so forth so there's
00:20:15.650 probably going to be about five or six
00:20:16.850 videos on on levels and why
00:20:19.040 do what they do and I'm gonna leave it
00:20:23.030 at that for now because because levels
00:20:24.410 get quite advanced so that's going to be
00:20:27.500 the fundamentals of trading the things I
00:20:28.820 want you guys start wrapping your minds
00:20:30.050 around focusing on levels trans
00:20:32.960 accumulation distribution just-just-just
00:20:35.210 the things that I want you to be aware
00:20:36.680 of going into these videos this this
00:20:39.380 right here
00:20:41.140 you know let's put this in read how
00:20:43.970 important it is or Red's not noticeable
00:20:46.460 enough let's go green Green's good so
00:20:49.300 this this is the fundamentals of trading
00:20:52.220 this is the foundation of why we trade
00:20:55.910 and how we see trades and yeah next what
00:21:00.050 type of trader are you are you a swing
00:21:01.670 trader scalp trader or you a long trader
00:21:04.100 there's two different types of traders
00:21:05.890 both have different methodologies they
00:21:09.890 both follow the same principles and
00:21:12.620 ideas but identifying what type of
00:21:14.930 trader you are
00:21:15.770 are you a swing scalp traders are you
00:21:17.240 the kind of person that enjoys that
00:21:18.500 15-minute rush because you see something
00:21:20.330 and you like to be in and out of a trade
00:21:22.820 or do you like to sit in a long term
00:21:25.370 trade you know buy one coin at a level
00:21:29.660 and and wait a week two weeks three
00:21:31.760 weeks a month four days four days might
00:21:34.310 be a long trade for you right so knowing
00:21:37.100 what type of trader you are is important
00:21:38.540 so identify that to yourself that's
00:21:40.430 something I can't answer tell you you
00:21:42.170 know you're gonna be this or that or
00:21:43.640 which is better horses whatever works
00:21:45.350 for you but but identify what works for
00:21:48.110 you so you so that we can build that
00:21:49.760 strategy around you because I'll be
00:21:52.490 touching on both of these and in the
00:21:54.440 different situations in which swing and
00:21:56.360 scalp trader may want to take certain
00:21:58.310 approaches and the long trader so so the
00:22:00.590 only thing I want you to do is identify
00:22:01.700 what type you like to be myself I'm both
00:22:04.820 so in my opinion being having having a
00:22:08.720 blending of both of these styles is more
00:22:13.130 beneficial because you're if this is 50%
00:22:15.560 of the trades on the market and this is
00:22:17.180 another 50% of the trades on the market
00:22:19.520 why not expose yourself to a hundred
00:22:21.290 percent so I'll leave it at that
00:22:23.090 ditch the indicators for now really
00:22:25.580 important thing I want to touch on is is
00:22:27.320 indicators
00:22:30.480 I want you guys to use no indicators in
00:22:34.590 my professional training career the only
00:22:36.180 indicators I use on my charts are moving
00:22:40.410 averages and very rarely volume weighted
00:22:43.290 average price so bebop moving averages
00:22:46.290 are really the only indicators I use
00:22:47.760 indicators will not tell you how to
00:22:50.190 trade you know Bollinger Bands Casey you
00:22:55.410 know whatever MACD volume for now I want
00:22:59.790 you to ditch the indicators there it
00:23:03.150 happens too often when people use
00:23:04.650 indicators and they try one strategy
00:23:06.360 because they read an article about it
00:23:07.890 online and it says you know trade MACD
00:23:10.200 like this when it crosses this level to
00:23:12.570 this level because it's creating some
00:23:13.830 type of divergence and and while those
00:23:15.450 things can be true you know a large
00:23:19.200 amount of the time more often than not
00:23:20.880 people they try these indicators they
00:23:24.450 fail them for whatever reason they they
00:23:26.700 kind of they lose money they scratch
00:23:27.990 their head and say man why did I why did
00:23:29.490 I lose money on that trade this
00:23:30.570 indicator I did it right and then they
00:23:32.100 they go in and ditch that indicator and
00:23:34.380 read a new article that was released you
00:23:36.450 know five days ago because it's newer or
00:23:38.510 it has more votes or whatever and they
00:23:41.220 say well this indicator is great because
00:23:44.550 you can do this with it and that
00:23:46.050 indicator trading all those indicators
00:23:48.120 are our data data that has been averaged
00:23:51.330 over samples of time data can't tell you
00:23:54.870 what a move is going to do data can only
00:23:57.290 tell you the history of what that coin
00:24:03.330 has done it can't tell you what it's
00:24:04.410 going to do in the future and it can't
00:24:05.910 give you indications and tip-offs of
00:24:07.620 what's going to happen next levels do
00:24:09.810 that trends do that and accumulation and
00:24:13.200 distribution do that data does not what
00:24:15.330 has happened in the past has nothing to
00:24:16.950 do with what a coin is going to do in
00:24:18.510 the future with the exception of trends
00:24:21.450 I'm not talking about trends you have a
00:24:22.980 valley created here and you have a
00:24:24.600 valley Target close you know for you
00:24:27.360 advanced traders who are thinking old
00:24:29.700 data can tell you things you're right a
00:24:30.840 can but indicators are I'm not a fan of
00:24:36.600 indicators I have traded very
00:24:38.460 successfully for a long time without the
00:24:39.960 use of them
00:24:41.120 believe in them and I believe in levels
00:24:44.960 and I believe in targets and and I'm
00:24:47.180 going to leave it at that I'm just like
00:24:49.160 everything else we're gonna put that
00:24:50.210 behind us I want you guys to ditch the
00:24:51.620 indicators for now in the advanced
00:24:53.180 courses I will get into one or two
00:24:54.890 indicators that can be useful one of
00:24:57.170 them being volume the reason volume can
00:25:00.440 be useful as it can it can tell you
00:25:02.060 what's happening during the move they
00:25:04.070 call it volume climax climax in in
00:25:06.800 trading can tell you where a move us
00:25:08.390 going and when it's done MACD can show
00:25:12.080 you divergence and volume can show you
00:25:13.730 what's called climax and will you know
00:25:16.160 dive into those and moving averages can
00:25:17.930 show you levels but you're not you're
00:25:21.140 not buying and exiting coins based on
00:25:24.770 moving averages so moving averages
00:25:26.240 really can't tell you what a good buy is
00:25:28.070 if you're buying based on moving
00:25:29.360 averages you're buying too late and
00:25:31.280 you're selling too early let's so let's
00:25:32.630 let's put it that way the truth about
00:25:35.330 news a lot of traders I've met in my
00:25:38.090 life want to trade news and they've got
00:25:39.590 you know all these apps open and they've
00:25:42.410 got their desktop filled with block
00:25:44.720 folio and all these different things and
00:25:46.520 and they and they want to chase the news
00:25:48.740 so anytime a news article comes out
00:25:50.360 they're buying in hopes that it moves up
00:25:53.120 or down I think it burned a lot of the
00:25:56.480 time News does not affect the trajectory
00:26:01.280 of a coin I'll give you an example
00:26:03.230 ripple ripple took a massive spike up
00:26:06.350 from I think it was around 4000 cents
00:26:08.930 all the way up to I believe it was
00:26:11.210 12,000 it could have been 20 I think it
00:26:14.060 was 12,000 SATs it moved up it was
00:26:15.830 12,000 you need to understand something
00:26:19.400 ripple was in heavy accumulation and I'm
00:26:21.620 going to bring the ripple chart up for
00:26:24.590 this example because I want to oh it was
00:26:28.700 already up okay but that's okay we'll
00:26:30.860 just leave it up them go BTC let's go
00:26:35.180 just finance okay share first one okay
00:26:38.300 I've got some levels here not important
00:26:40.960 you know what I'm gonna do I'm going to
00:26:42.830 clear to clear my ripple chart here I
00:26:44.590 can always do this later right
00:26:48.610 before this kind of
00:26:52.550 insane move up that ripple tuck here all
00:26:55.070 the way from you know four thousand SATs
00:26:57.350 and even if we just go in and draw us
00:26:59.150 some basic levels you went to traded the
00:27:03.440 news on this you you went to said okay
00:27:05.240 let's trade the news because the news
00:27:07.610 made us made us move up know the level
00:27:10.160 made you move up and and not just the
00:27:13.820 level but we're on a weekly chart right
00:27:15.350 now so this is you know the last form of
00:27:18.950 distribution happened here this was the
00:27:20.720 Fertile okay let's redo that without the
00:27:22.580 magnet tool and let's move this over a
00:27:24.920 bit so everybody can see it let's let's
00:27:28.670 let's talk about accumulation and
00:27:29.900 distribution so we can clear up some of
00:27:31.700 this new stuff look right here before
00:27:33.290 going too far back
00:27:34.370 this was accumulation right this was the
00:27:37.309 low right here off a previous level and
00:27:39.290 I'm a hundred percent sure that was a
00:27:40.820 previous level but I'm not going to do
00:27:44.360 that right now so this is this is a form
00:27:48.559 of distribution and that the tail end of
00:27:50.330 distribution off this move up and and
00:27:52.460 this was accumulation based on a level
00:27:54.190 previous right beat some of these so
00:27:58.010 this coin moves up right has a final
00:28:01.160 target of distribution here for whatever
00:28:03.559 reason for you know going going back
00:28:07.100 into what is this January just like
00:28:09.710 Bitcoin right distribution happens here
00:28:12.170 right comes all the way down here
00:28:14.290 accumulation happens here coin moves up
00:28:16.880 has a target distribution coin lose down
00:28:20.090 has a target coin rows up and so on and
00:28:22.730 so forth so in this ripple move
00:28:25.300 forgetting about this weekly chart come
00:28:28.160 on keep going back here let's now break
00:28:30.679 it down to the daily so on this daily
00:28:33.380 chart we created a swing low level here
00:28:35.570 okay
00:28:37.090 this was from January at this point in
00:28:41.630 heavy accumulation so accumulation is
00:28:44.179 happening all right here right and even
00:28:48.920 you can even you can even call a
00:28:50.210 cumulation kind of this whole whole zone
00:28:52.580 right here after this move down here
00:28:55.429 this move down happens here it creates
00:28:57.440 our low right and you can call this
00:29:00.770 whole yellow box a form of accumulation
00:29:02.990 with with moves within it right
00:29:05.809 so let's dissect this move a little
00:29:08.610 further mmm the news really caused this
00:29:11.549 move to go up right and we're going to
00:29:13.289 talk about that in a minute so this
00:29:16.500 comes up here distribution happens right
00:29:19.409 this is all distribution as distribution
00:29:21.750 is exhausting accumulation is happening
00:29:24.539 right so this move is in the tail end of
00:29:26.340 its move this here is important because
00:29:30.480 this actually didn't touch our support
00:29:33.090 when this rejects that support touch
00:29:35.220 right there there's there's more buying
00:29:37.320 presence in it so this creates a new low
00:29:39.659 for us right all right here let's put
00:29:45.960 our magnet to long get this raid on the
00:29:47.669 wick right that's the wick there let's
00:29:51.390 move further into this move right we can
00:29:53.520 see that this was rejected this is
00:29:55.890 accumulation right here this is when
00:29:58.080 this this point everybody is buying
00:29:59.970 because distribution is exhausted this
00:30:02.460 was the start of that news article what
00:30:06.029 you guys have to realize is these
00:30:07.679 companies they plan these news and
00:30:10.770 releases in heavy accumulation periods
00:30:13.919 so that the value of their asset goes as
00:30:17.429 high as it possibly can they will not
00:30:19.350 release this news some sometime mid here
00:30:23.549 right because this coin is a
00:30:25.380 distribution it has to go into long-term
00:30:26.850 accumulation and companies do this
00:30:29.070 because they want the most asset value
00:30:32.010 out of that coin right so you have to
00:30:34.110 think about it you have to put yourself
00:30:34.980 in their shoes when is the best time to
00:30:37.320 release news it's won a coin has been in
00:30:39.840 heavy accumulation because what's going
00:30:41.279 to happen is is everybody who's bought
00:30:43.970 reduces the supply for the market so it
00:30:46.770 makes this move up more ferocious so
00:30:50.270 everybody out there who's trading the
00:30:52.380 news and who is using all these signals
00:30:55.460 you can do that it's not a strategy I
00:30:57.929 use and I would I would caution you
00:31:00.360 against it because if you're training
00:31:01.649 the news you've bought too late you know
00:31:04.679 if you're trading the news right you
00:31:07.289 would have saw this news article release
00:31:09.020 and you would have bought here right
00:31:11.580 this this move happened instantly right
00:31:14.880 that move happened when when ripple had
00:31:17.610 that big news and
00:31:18.480 about whatever the the banking project
00:31:20.999 they were working under there sorry
00:31:22.019 sorry the new cryptocurrency project
00:31:24.269 they were working on this movement was
00:31:25.710 already and it was already in and you
00:31:27.090 you didn't you didn't buy here because
00:31:28.470 you missed out right instead you bought
00:31:30.600 here so had you bought the level you
00:31:33.809 would have bought here right so ditch
00:31:38.369 trading the news it's it's it's you you
00:31:41.700 get late entries and there's better ways
00:31:43.109 to trade trading the news is not a
00:31:45.359 strategy that's used it's it's something
00:31:47.789 people do they follow the news and they
00:31:49.259 chase the news and most times more than
00:31:51.600 not they're getting burned on bad
00:31:53.070 entries yeah true the truth of all news
00:31:56.609 let's leave it at that
00:31:59.720 don't be a news trader
00:32:01.470 it's it's it's you can't make a career
00:32:03.269 in day trading out of trading the news
00:32:05.279 and if you live that strategy works for
00:32:06.899 you and you want to continue it by all
00:32:08.519 means but in my experience I think it's
00:32:10.440 not the right way to do things
00:32:12.179 reading candles there is a lot of
00:32:15.029 material out there on reading candles
00:32:18.239 and and what it means for you know every
00:32:20.759 individual candle whether it be a bigwig
00:32:26.460 like this or kind of an indecision
00:32:28.679 candle like this like a doji candle or a
00:32:31.710 hammer a shooting star or what not
00:32:36.440 reading candles again trading is about
00:32:39.389 levels support resistance trends and
00:32:42.659 accumulation and distribution a lot of
00:32:46.259 times I see people trading and and they
00:32:48.269 watch the candles like a hawk and
00:32:50.159 they're watching these these candles
00:32:51.570 religiously and they are trying to trade
00:32:54.239 in the minute every single second of the
00:32:55.830 trade and that's not how we trade that's
00:32:59.070 not how professionals do it they don't
00:33:00.239 read the candles there's a way to tell
00:33:01.559 what moves are exhausting when a move
00:33:03.809 has exhausted itself and candles will
00:33:06.600 tell you that but but you don't want to
00:33:09.299 be a trader based on candles I want you
00:33:12.029 to ditch the indicators I want you to
00:33:14.009 know the truth about news and not trade
00:33:16.200 the news and I don't want you to trade
00:33:18.600 based on reading candles reading candles
00:33:20.989 will not help you in your trades it will
00:33:24.499 it can help you exit a trade but you
00:33:28.950 already know where your exist in your
00:33:30.179 entries are based on targets
00:33:31.600 right so reading candles you don't have
00:33:35.320 to watch trades religiously and and read
00:33:37.809 the candles and say oh this is a
00:33:39.070 spinning top or whatever type of candle
00:33:41.230 it is that's what I don't want you to do
00:33:43.030 these three things in red is what you're
00:33:45.610 not going to do ditching the indicators
00:33:48.400 let's change the wording on that let's
00:33:50.770 see using indicators and then in
00:33:55.150 brackets I'm going to put four now
00:33:56.440 because we will use one or two minute
00:33:58.030 indicators in the future and I will go
00:33:59.440 over them in great detail in a more
00:34:00.730 advanced course but using indicators for
00:34:03.640 now I don't want you to do trading the
00:34:06.760 news let's put it that way
00:34:08.969 Trading the news I don't want you to do
00:34:12.668 that and I don't want you to be reading
00:34:14.859 candles for trades those are the three
00:34:17.139 things I don't want you to do next thing
00:34:20.770 is having the right tools and a lot of
00:34:24.250 times I see easy you know I'm helping
00:34:26.230 people out and and they're new to
00:34:27.489 trading and they're using you know
00:34:29.109 something like their exchange view like
00:34:31.719 okay X or buy Nance for trading view I
00:34:34.000 want you to guys I want you guys to use
00:34:35.770 the right tools you know if you're gonna
00:34:37.690 build a house you don't use bubble gums
00:34:40.239 instead of nails you know if you're a
00:34:41.739 framer you're not gonna you're not going
00:34:43.179 to put together two by fours and two by
00:34:44.530 sixes to build a structural wall with
00:34:47.050 bubble gum you're going to use you know
00:34:49.810 certain type of anchor nails or whatever
00:34:51.159 but you're gonna use the right tools and
00:34:53.168 our tool in training as trading software
00:34:56.770 is specific for me I use trading view I
00:34:59.380 love it
00:35:02.070 it's it's it's my tool of choice you
00:35:07.090 know I have no affiliation with them
00:35:08.560 obviously just my tool of choice I use
00:35:12.640 trading view whatever you guys want to
00:35:14.500 use use it but trading view has free
00:35:16.480 accounts and it's it's used by a lot of
00:35:18.490 people and that's where you'll find my
00:35:20.080 charts anyways when I do do them is I'm
00:35:23.500 training you so I would recommend
00:35:25.030 trading view but you use whatever you
00:35:27.130 want I don't care what tool you use as
00:35:28.750 long as it's not an exchange view I
00:35:31.570 don't want to see you know if you're
00:35:33.580 gonna send me a chart to look at I won't
00:35:35.290 look at by Nancy charts I won't look at
00:35:36.790 things like that I want to see propper
00:35:39.490 charts done on software because that's
00:35:40.930 what serious traders are gonna do and if
00:35:42.339 you want to do this professionally
00:35:43.820 you would want to have professional
00:35:45.470 tools so something I can interact with
00:35:49.490 like I said I recommend trading view but
00:35:51.200 I'll leave that up to you the most
00:35:54.920 important thing about trading is
00:35:57.560 discipline you know the last thing we're
00:35:59.180 going to touch on just just in the
00:36:00.380 fundamentals of this and what I want you
00:36:02.330 guys to absorb before we get into
00:36:04.810 building you guys up and creating you
00:36:07.940 guys as professional day traders is
00:36:10.570 discipline is something I was very
00:36:14.240 fortunate to learn in poker when I
00:36:15.830 played poker and bankroll management I
00:36:17.570 don't know how many times I lost
00:36:18.830 thousands of dollars because I had poor
00:36:21.050 bankroll management and I couldn't
00:36:22.700 control my emotions and it took me a
00:36:24.890 long time many years of pain and
00:36:27.530 emotional destruction and just just
00:36:32.210 complete psychological torture of you
00:36:35.540 know not respecting my bankroll and its
00:36:37.790 limitations and loading up thousands of
00:36:40.190 dollars to play on a poker table and
00:36:41.510 then losing thousands of dollars and and
00:36:44.359 going through emotional torture and
00:36:47.320 having sleepless nights where I had
00:36:50.840 nightmares on I couldn't sleep and I had
00:36:52.400 anxiety and you know my heart would race
00:36:54.590 and just just the emotional torture the
00:36:57.830 the baggage and the mental anchors that
00:37:01.580 not having proper control over your
00:37:03.680 finances gives you and you know it's
00:37:05.990 it's it's it's tough because you know
00:37:08.660 and I remember in poker you know I would
00:37:11.180 have you know $3,000 on my account and
00:37:13.400 proper bankroll management states that I
00:37:14.990 need 100 buy-ins for whatever limit I'm
00:37:16.580 playing so you know with $3,000 I want
00:37:19.250 to feel like an all-star I want to trade
00:37:20.780 big amounts of money and I want to take
00:37:24.830 you know 600 of about thirty thousand
00:37:27.020 dollars and put it on a table and and
00:37:28.550 then when I lose that $600 on one buy
00:37:30.500 and I want to go and load up 1200 which
00:37:32.300 is you know the next half of that
00:37:33.530 bankroll so I only essentially have
00:37:35.420 three buy-ins and you know I I you lose
00:37:42.440 it all and it's emotional torture and it
00:37:44.240 goes fast so discipline and controlling
00:37:46.850 the losses in trading is the most
00:37:48.950 important thing we call it bankroll
00:37:52.580 management you call account management
00:37:54.640 discipline
00:37:56.380 and humility and being humble about your
00:37:58.739 account is important whether you're
00:38:00.910 starting out with $100 or you're
00:38:02.859 starting with 5,000 or maybe ten
00:38:04.869 thousand or fifty thousand or a hundred
00:38:06.339 thousand or five hundred thousand
00:38:07.920 whatever your trade budget is discipline
00:38:11.049 and and being able to control your
00:38:12.759 losses and mitigate the risk behind
00:38:15.519 trading you know there's there's a kind
00:38:19.599 of a nominal saying and a well-known
00:38:22.119 saying this is very Universal in the
00:38:25.059 trading world is that if you have ten
00:38:26.559 trades
00:38:26.979 okay and in those ten trades if seven of
00:38:30.640 them are losing trades and three of them
00:38:32.829 are winning trades so you have a 30% win
00:38:34.690 ratio you can make very good money that
00:38:36.910 way and the reason being is because
00:38:38.650 those seven trades you limited the
00:38:40.630 amount of risk to one or two percent of
00:38:43.779 the trade and whatever formula works for
00:38:46.569 you we won't get into that later again
00:38:48.670 in a more advanced course but you know
00:38:52.420 if you have one percent loss on seven
00:38:54.849 trades but you've made five percent on
00:38:57.670 three trades you're negative seven
00:38:59.380 percent from the bad trades plus four
00:39:00.729 five percent over three trades it's just
00:39:02.259 plus fifteen percent which balances two
00:39:03.789 plus eight percent positive trades
00:39:05.890 profit / loss so in in in three winning
00:39:09.910 trades and seven losing trades sounds
00:39:11.349 like a losing trade sounds like a losing
00:39:13.359 trader but in reality you're up eight
00:39:15.670 percent on those ten trades so there's a
00:39:18.219 formula and a way to control your your
00:39:20.829 bankroll and ensure that you are going
00:39:23.680 to be successful at trading and to limit
00:39:26.739 those losses but but it can't happen
00:39:29.289 without your own discipline you know
00:39:31.630 take it from somebody or you maybe you
00:39:33.670 have a similar experience like this
00:39:35.469 similar experience like me take it from
00:39:37.660 somebody who has gone through the
00:39:39.430 emotional torture and you know years of
00:39:41.200 anxiety in losing money in poker and
00:39:44.819 trading and embrace that suffering and
00:39:47.410 be humble about it and you know tell the
00:39:51.460 stories about how you lost money in
00:39:53.680 trading you know you always hear the
00:39:55.660 stories about how people make all these
00:39:57.670 great trades and make all these all this
00:39:59.920 you know I made 20% on on this trade
00:40:02.529 because it went up and you know I took a
00:40:04.150 chance and I made 20% but you never hear
00:40:05.769 guys talk about how yeah man I took this
00:40:09.099 trade and I didn't have my
00:40:10.190 stop losses in place and I licked off
00:40:12.320 15% of my account I felt terrible and
00:40:14.990 cost me five grand and now I can't you
00:40:16.910 know pay for groceries this month and
00:40:18.350 because I wasn't disciplined enough to
00:40:20.530 to know the fundamentals or you know
00:40:23.210 apply the knowledge that I know or have
00:40:25.370 some type of control over my account
00:40:26.930 you don't hear those stories you don't
00:40:29.180 you only hear the stories about how guys
00:40:30.380 made hold on trades and it's like no
00:40:32.810 there's a suffering and trading there's
00:40:34.310 a suffering and you need to embrace that
00:40:35.360 and learn discipline so you can control
00:40:37.460 it right it's it's a great tool that
00:40:39.290 pain and that INE is a great tool and
00:40:41.330 when you control it it can't hurt you
00:40:42.560 and when you have reduced risk and you
00:40:45.890 mitigate those losses it can't hurt you
00:40:48.200 it can't it can't give you sleepless
00:40:50.510 nights and nights and anxiety and it
00:40:52.670 won't make you sit by charts you know I
00:40:55.340 remember nights when I would check my
00:40:57.020 phone 20 times a night I would wake up
00:40:58.970 and I would I would look at my phone I
00:41:00.080 would sleep for half an hour and I'd
00:41:01.340 look at my phone my mobile and I would
00:41:03.560 look at my trade and see how it's doing
00:41:04.760 and sometimes I would rush you know
00:41:06.560 downstairs in my house and I would I
00:41:07.940 would I would do something to the trade
00:41:09.260 and it was it was agony you know just
00:41:12.280 important lesson is discipline learn how
00:41:16.430 to use it and put it in your corner as a
00:41:18.650 tool and and it will treat you well and
00:41:20.540 it will help you mitigate risk and it's
00:41:22.550 it's one of the most important things
00:41:23.750 about becoming a professional trader is
00:41:25.430 is is constantly building your bankroll
00:41:28.220 but you know almost trying to get to a
00:41:31.700 point where you never have losses
00:41:32.930 because as you get to professional level
00:41:35.000 you will never have losses in trading
00:41:37.010 not never you'll have losses but they'll
00:41:39.110 be small they'll be controlled you lose
00:41:40.220 a percent here and a percent there and
00:41:41.660 you might go two weeks of losing a
00:41:42.800 percent here and a percent there but
00:41:44.000 then you know you'll snap out of it with
00:41:45.680 four or five good trades and all that
00:41:47.090 loss will be offset by one good trade
00:41:48.680 and then you'll have two more to boost
00:41:51.740 you up and you'll feel great so that's
00:41:54.110 it for now everybody this was the course
00:41:57.290 one the fundamentals and it was mostly
00:41:59.120 theory and and talking and something I
00:42:01.850 wanted you guys to understand you know
00:42:04.670 might be a little boring visually but
00:42:07.070 important nonetheless things I want you
00:42:10.040 to keep in mind and moving forward we're
00:42:13.970 going to start talking about the
00:42:17.180 different nuances in trading
00:42:21.580 all the different tools and tactics that
00:42:25.360 you're going to need to become a
00:42:26.350 professional trader and just going off
00:42:28.780 the list I'm just going to copy and
00:42:29.920 paste something here real quick so what
00:42:33.370 are we going to do next we're going to
00:42:34.390 talk about accumulation and distribution
00:42:35.800 in the next video the video after that
00:42:37.930 is going to be targets and then levels
00:42:40.030 of support resistance how to identify
00:42:41.500 them properly momentum will be the video
00:42:44.800 following why patterns form and what do
00:42:46.930 they mean wedges rising and falling also
00:42:50.530 known as barren both legs trends larger
00:42:53.170 time frames versus smaller timeframes
00:42:54.960 Fibonacci levels and that'll be a bulk
00:42:59.020 of the beginners course and then you
00:43:00.430 know we'll get into medium advanced and
00:43:01.900 you know some different things but those
00:43:03.910 are a few of the ideas that you have to
00:43:05.980 look forward to soon to come and and
00:43:08.770 stay tuned thanks for the audience for
00:43:10.960 the first video and I will see you in
00:43:12.550 the next one

00:00:16.800 account I post on my training view and
00:00:18.779 Twitter links there as well as update
00:00:21.420 people on content and what's coming up
00:00:22.920 for material and so forth so alright
00:00:25.800 without further ado let's get into it
00:00:27.420 what are patterns okay let's switch over
00:00:30.720 to our chart here and today we're going
00:00:32.940 to be focusing on basic attention token
00:00:34.950 it's received a lot of attention lately
00:00:39.110 so yeah we're gonna be focusing on bat
00:00:41.250 today so what are patterns patterns are
00:00:43.950 exactly what they sound like they are
00:00:45.059 patterns in the market that repeat
00:00:46.680 themselves they are they are trends and
00:00:48.450 patterns and things that happen and you
00:00:50.640 guys have seen on charts kind of these
00:00:53.480 valleys right things like this this this
00:00:56.430 is a pattern right this is this valley
00:00:58.050 is a pattern that repeats itself you can
00:01:00.210 see one there you can see one here right
00:01:03.090 you continue going on you see out of
00:01:05.489 there
00:01:05.790 oops you see another valley right here
00:01:09.840 right so these are these kind of and you
00:01:13.200 see you know another one right here
00:01:17.159 so patterns are things that happen in
00:01:19.950 the market kind of over and over and
00:01:22.110 over and you know the most important
00:01:23.820 part of patterns are trend lines right
00:01:25.830 so what is a trend line a trend line is
00:01:29.070 what forms these patterns and these
00:01:31.140 peaks and valleys so a trend line would
00:01:34.590 be something like this where you have
00:01:37.009 basically a support and resistance line
00:01:39.299 that happens as moves are going on and
00:01:42.990 they happen on all time frames they
00:01:44.100 happen everything from the 15 minute all
00:01:46.140 the way up to the weekly and monthly
00:01:47.399 charts and kind of these these trend
00:01:50.070 lines and these patterns that occur in
00:01:52.590 the markets will just draw a few here so
00:01:55.649 we can look at them what we talk these
00:01:58.530 patterns that occur in the markets these
00:02:00.000 these trend lines they kind of set a
00:02:03.600 parameter right you have levels of
00:02:06.149 support resistance and you have trends
00:02:08.669 so those are the kind of the the two
00:02:10.679 founding things that act
00:02:12.600 support resistance levels Marky's - to
00:02:16.800 break through and move and for the
00:02:18.570 market to kind of change direction or or
00:02:20.430 make a reversal you you you you have
00:02:23.730 trend lines and you have levels okay so
00:02:25.860 we're gonna look at a few trend lines
00:02:27.120 here and we're gonna discuss what they
00:02:29.580 are okay let's go back to the material
00:02:35.070 for a second so what are patterns so
00:02:37.470 that's what patterns are and why your
00:02:39.300 patterns so important okay
00:02:41.910 let's go through this and start
00:02:43.770 identifying some patterns here and
00:02:45.690 talking about why they're so important
00:02:47.000 patterns are important because they are
00:02:49.320 telling you what's going on in the move
00:02:51.180 in the moment right if if we just draw a
00:02:55.080 simple pattern right here we're gonna
00:02:57.000 take this order sorry to try and like
00:02:59.010 wall trend is a pattern so that's okay
00:03:00.450 call it trying to call it a pattern
00:03:01.650 called whatever you want you know you
00:03:03.240 can just kind of take this this swing
00:03:06.570 high right here right this is the swing
00:03:08.820 high that started to move down and it
00:03:10.710 creates this trend line or this pattern
00:03:13.680 that you can see that it has to actually
00:03:15.870 come and kind of don't make it too long
00:03:18.750 it's being a little a little funky on us
00:03:20.760 turn that often try that again you can
00:03:23.340 see this trend line here this trend
00:03:24.960 pattern we need this pattern to trend
00:03:26.640 line whatever you whichever term you
00:03:27.900 prefer you can see it kind of does this
00:03:30.150 thing where it respects almost like a
00:03:32.010 level of resistance because that's what
00:03:33.570 a trend or a pattern is it's it creates
00:03:35.550 a level of resistance right and you can
00:03:38.550 kind of see it until it finally has a
00:03:40.680 chance to move sideways and break
00:03:41.880 through does that move not stop bleeding
00:03:44.910 or or moving down these down trends or
00:03:47.160 up trends right you know same thing over
00:03:50.490 here right when this when this when when
00:03:53.730 basic attention token was moving up you
00:03:55.800 know let's take the swing high of this
00:03:57.090 move and let's let's take it and we'll
00:03:59.640 take it to the next one high which is
00:04:00.930 right here right it would have been this
00:04:03.570 swing high is what started the move here
00:04:04.860 okay we might need the magnet tool back
00:04:07.500 on for this one the swing high here to
00:04:10.160 this swing high here race you've got a
00:04:12.660 swing high or could have been this one
00:04:13.950 and so it all lines up the same it
00:04:15.120 doesn't matter so you've got this
00:04:16.829 uptrend right or this this up upwards
00:04:19.680 pattern and you can kind of see how this
00:04:21.570 upward pattern is
00:04:23.320 kind of respected the whole way through
00:04:24.730 as is almost like a level of resistance
00:04:26.740 now we didn't we didn't draw levels of
00:04:29.290 resistance yet we are going to add into
00:04:31.000 this chart to kind of integrate the idea
00:04:32.830 of patterns and trends with levels of
00:04:35.740 resistance and support but you can see
00:04:37.570 how this this trend or this pattern acts
00:04:40.390 as resistance constantly to this coin
00:04:42.610 until it finally goes up over and comes
00:04:44.470 back down and breaks and then it kind of
00:04:46.480 ends its trend right there when it when
00:04:48.010 it loses its trend it kind of ends it
00:04:49.570 right there and we'll talk about that in
00:04:50.710 a future video only no I'll say that
00:04:52.500 more advanced topic for a more advanced
00:04:54.730 lesson but the really the point of this
00:04:56.740 video is to kind of identify trends and
00:04:59.830 patterns and give clarity to what they
00:05:01.840 mean and what they do so that we can
00:05:03.340 build upon that in future lessons right
00:05:04.930 then we see it come up here and it still
00:05:06.880 touches us as it would as you know that
00:05:09.340 that level of resistance and then it
00:05:11.290 continues on and let's take a look here
00:05:13.890 the beginning of the down move here just
00:05:16.600 turn that magnet tool back on beginning
00:05:18.400 over the down move here to this swing
00:05:19.780 right here right so that's how you can
00:05:22.240 start to identify these patterns or
00:05:26.080 these trends is its swings of moves
00:05:28.450 right that's swing highs and swing lows
00:05:30.240 to the continuing swing higher swing low
00:05:34.500 and we'll go over a bit more in detail
00:05:36.940 how do you identify those but just to
00:05:39.460 show you why they're so important when
00:05:40.660 you have these trends right let's turn
00:05:43.030 the magnet tool back off again it's been
00:05:44.440 funny when you have these trends of
00:05:46.480 these patterns they create this level of
00:05:49.240 resistance that you need to break
00:05:50.980 through right until you can kind of stop
00:05:53.980 this and you know at that point and when
00:05:56.050 it breaks through that is when you kind
00:05:59.680 of have the the continuation of the move
00:06:01.960 and it can kind of get out of that
00:06:03.960 downwards movement and start a new trend
00:06:06.340 or a new pattern right if we were to
00:06:08.680 look at here and and this this applies
00:06:10.540 to the bottom of trends too right so
00:06:13.060 sometimes you're using the top sometimes
00:06:14.500 you're using the bottoms and you know we
00:06:16.750 will get into that another time but
00:06:19.300 right here you know if we were to take
00:06:21.190 the swing low of this move and move it
00:06:23.680 to the swing low of that move let's turn
00:06:26.380 the magnet to a lawn for that one the
00:06:28.150 swing low there to the swing low there
00:06:29.770 you can see how this pattern or this
00:06:34.690 trend that was created is constantly
00:06:36.070 acting as support
00:06:37.039 turn that magnet back off it's
00:06:39.289 constantly acting as support right you
00:06:40.969 can see it acts as support to further
00:06:43.009 this move and it continues as acting as
00:06:45.499 support until it acts as resistance
00:06:48.080 right because we broke through it then
00:06:49.189 it acts as resistance and resistance
00:06:51.409 again here and it tries to break through
00:06:52.729 but it kind of then fails and acts as
00:06:54.110 resistance there and that this might not
00:06:56.509 be that it failed where we circled or
00:06:58.719 broke it and failed but this could
00:07:02.300 possibly be something on a larger time
00:07:05.270 frame right this could possibly be you
00:07:08.839 see where we circled it here that it
00:07:10.789 actually didn't go through that trend
00:07:12.770 it's because it never really lost the
00:07:14.089 trend on the weekly like on the daily it
00:07:15.559 might have looked like it was lost but
00:07:16.939 on the weekly it never was lost so kind
00:07:19.969 of keep in mind that time frames do have
00:07:23.199 kind of a harsh a crucial role in in in
00:07:28.939 identifying these trends because it
00:07:30.319 might look like on a daily chart this
00:07:32.479 thing broke down and then it broke back
00:07:34.189 up and it's gaining and losing up but
00:07:35.779 maybe if you know we switched over to
00:07:37.279 the weekly simple simply switched over
00:07:38.899 to the weekly here and saw that well it
00:07:42.080 actually never lost the weekly trend
00:07:43.729 until this point right and then you know
00:07:47.029 until this point right here and it did
00:07:50.059 stay above this trendline on a weekly
00:07:52.069 chart so you can kind of see how
00:07:56.080 timeframes they will play an important
00:07:58.339 role okay they will play an important
00:08:00.559 role and identifying some of this stuff
00:08:02.120 and sometimes it's daily sometimes it's
00:08:03.559 weekly the point being is that these
00:08:05.509 trends they exist everywhere right we
00:08:08.419 can find them everywhere in charts right
00:08:10.129 the the swing high of this what started
00:08:12.979 this down move to the next swing high
00:08:14.599 which would be there let's drag that out
00:08:16.819 and see what it looks like right
00:08:18.129 resistance resistance support you see
00:08:21.559 these trends they exist everywhere let's
00:08:24.019 do another one the swing high of this -
00:08:27.319 that one right there right until it move
00:08:29.779 sideways it doesn't stop this downtrend
00:08:32.059 until it can move sideways and break
00:08:33.769 through it and now you'll note you'll
00:08:35.240 notice something interesting here it's a
00:08:36.948 this this downtrend that starts over 1 2
00:08:39.948 3 4 5 days right this downtrend it loses
00:08:43.519 that level comes down here move sideways
00:08:46.699 and breaks and then it immediately tests
00:08:48.589 not once but twice
00:08:50.630 this trendline that we have that slices
00:08:52.970 right through so these these trend lines
00:08:55.010 they can act as future support
00:08:58.070 resistance over larger time frames and
00:08:59.870 you can see it you know right here all
00:09:01.820 we did was took the swing low and and
00:09:04.580 then and then the following swing low
00:09:06.170 and created a line that kind of
00:09:09.680 continues forever and then you know you
00:09:11.210 can even you can even do this where you
00:09:12.650 take that line right and you just simply
00:09:14.960 copy and paste it and at that point you
00:09:17.810 can crown it kind of create the channel
00:09:19.340 that this lives in and create kind of a
00:09:21.110 channel trend so what we would do here
00:09:22.970 is we take the swing low there's there's
00:09:25.550 there would be three points to recognize
00:09:27.080 here so I'll label them the swing low
00:09:28.520 would be one oops this would be 1 this
00:09:32.570 would be 2 and this would be 3 now the
00:09:35.990 reason this is 1 2 3 is number 1 this is
00:09:38.360 a swing low that started the up move
00:09:39.950 right it's not this back here because
00:09:41.990 this wasn't done moving down yet it
00:09:43.370 still kind of moved down this was a
00:09:44.660 swing low that started that move number
00:09:46.940 2 is a swing high before we see the next
00:09:49.010 swing low so this is going to be your
00:09:50.600 first swing high so number 2 is your
00:09:52.430 first swing high and then number three
00:09:54.920 is the identifying of the trend so you
00:09:57.110 would start here and you would simply
00:09:58.460 draw it to that next swing low and have
00:10:00.200 that line continue on forever so the
00:10:02.780 reason I'm showing you this again is
00:10:04.430 because if we were to simply copy and
00:10:06.080 paste this bottom line to this top on
00:10:08.090 all's we would do is we would take this
00:10:09.980 and we would drag that to that oops we
00:10:13.370 don't want to do that we want to keep it
00:10:14.480 the same we would simply drag this line
00:10:16.640 and put it to the top of that move now
00:10:20.300 let's kind of get in here real close and
00:10:21.830 get this kind of as perfect as we can
00:10:23.800 looks like right there right so now you
00:10:27.710 kind of create this channel right you
00:10:29.840 create kind of a swing low or a
00:10:31.400 trendline and it creates a pattern and a
00:10:33.740 channel that this lives in you know an
00:10:36.170 uptrend or a pattern trend and you guys
00:10:37.700 can see right as we walk through this
00:10:39.830 move again
00:10:41.210 this this channel here acts as support
00:10:44.690 resistance for this move let's turn this
00:10:46.160 magnet tool back off it's being a little
00:10:47.630 spicy again until it finally breaks out
00:10:50.240 right and when it breaks out it can move
00:10:52.790 up and then it comes down it creates
00:10:54.590 another downtrend well look at this it
00:10:56.420 catches the top of this trend and it
00:10:58.280 continues to use this as support until
00:11:01.280 it closes and breaks
00:11:02.910 and then bounces between them and uses
00:11:05.100 this as support and this as resistance
00:11:07.950 right and then it breaks through it and
00:11:09.750 then it's resistance there and you can
00:11:13.650 see as you move further through the move
00:11:15.060 going through some of these points here
00:11:16.950 it comes up and it tests this trendline
00:11:19.560 again right so it's got two kind of
00:11:21.120 levels to break here so oops
00:11:23.430 uh-huh we don't want to do that we don't
00:11:25.230 wanna change the point or the stock or
00:11:27.420 whatever so you can see how these trends
00:11:29.400 and patterns they create this bound of
00:11:31.680 levels of support and resistance right
00:11:33.930 now the next thing we're gonna do here
00:11:35.780 let's take a look at the course material
00:11:40.800 so pattern identification we went
00:11:42.030 through that wire patterns so important
00:11:44.040 trend reversal we're going to talk about
00:11:49.670 trend reversal a bit and we kind of
00:11:52.650 already did so this will be a pretty
00:11:54.930 easy thing for you guys to kind of see
00:11:57.300 now at this point trend reversal is
00:12:01.640 going to happen and before we do that
00:12:04.320 all we're gonna do is we're gonna go
00:12:05.610 draw a few levels on this chart we're
00:12:07.560 gonna we're gonna we're just gonna see
00:12:09.180 how cuz levels and trends and patterns
00:12:10.770 they all kind of interact with each
00:12:12.420 other so all we're gonna do is is draw a
00:12:14.490 few levels here so let's identify a few
00:12:17.070 things here let's go on the monthly and
00:12:19.050 on the monthly we're gonna make silver
00:12:20.510 kind of a move so we have a swing high
00:12:22.770 on the high candle right we have the
00:12:26.130 swing low of the low candle okay so
00:12:28.800 we're just identifying one kind of
00:12:31.860 monthly level year we're gonna keep it
00:12:33.090 very basic because you know simpler is
00:12:35.100 better in charting and ta the simpler
00:12:37.980 you can keep it the better you learn all
00:12:39.540 these advanced techniques and advanced
00:12:41.100 topics and also I'm sorry I forgot to
00:12:43.590 switch it over here I'll go through that
00:12:45.270 again real quick all we're gonna do is
00:12:47.370 just switch to the monthly chart and
00:12:48.990 we're gonna use silver here as the
00:12:51.780 monthly level and let's delete that and
00:12:53.970 just walk through this again because I
00:12:55.320 forgot to switch it over so all we're
00:12:57.360 doing is identifying the swing high of
00:12:59.130 the high move right and the swing low of
00:13:02.850 that same high move and like I was
00:13:05.640 saying before is these these tools that
00:13:08.250 we learn all these advanced topics it's
00:13:09.720 almost like you have to learn this whole
00:13:11.250 barrage of things in order to make it
00:13:13.920 simple you have to learn
00:13:14.960 you know from A to Z to then do your TA
00:13:18.140 and your charting with only using a B
00:13:20.570 and C but that a B and C are kind of the
00:13:23.000 three most important things you identify
00:13:25.130 through A to Z but in that a B and C
00:13:27.860 there's a little piece of D a little
00:13:29.720 piece of e F you know all the way up to
00:13:32.320 QRS the whole thing right so we learn
00:13:36.410 all these advanced topics and things so
00:13:37.940 that we can simplify it down and we can
00:13:40.610 make these as basic as possible now
00:13:43.550 we've identified a monthly swing high
00:13:46.370 and low right let's go look at our
00:13:49.550 weekly levels okay our weekly swing low
00:13:53.180 we are going to make oops
00:13:54.560 ah we are gonna make our weekly level
00:13:56.720 purple so this is kind of the swing low
00:13:59.690 here and this is the swing high of a
00:14:02.000 move and now whenever whenever a point
00:14:03.709 opens on an exchange you never use the
00:14:05.390 first candle because it's volatile you
00:14:07.010 never use the first daily the first 15
00:14:08.720 the first hour the first four-hour the
00:14:10.220 first weekly the first month in Canada
00:14:12.170 you never use it you always use the
00:14:13.700 second candle right it's a general rule
00:14:16.760 of thumb just because the amount of
00:14:18.500 volatility on that open is too high so
00:14:20.779 you're always using the next candle
00:14:22.279 you're always starting from there so
00:14:24.230 technically this would be our first
00:14:25.459 swing high right and then we have the
00:14:29.240 bottom side of that oops let's just use
00:14:34.160 this swing low here oh it won't even
00:14:36.680 matter if we whichever one we used
00:14:38.330 actually if we were to do this
00:14:39.740 technically accurate you know we
00:14:42.140 wouldn't even need this one so we've
00:14:44.570 identified a monthly a weekly and let's
00:14:47.270 identify maybe a daily level in here so
00:14:50.720 a daily level would be something in this
00:14:53.870 uptrend here right so as this is moving
00:14:56.209 up this swing high right let's see let's
00:15:01.010 walk through this so we have this move
00:15:02.390 up here swings high before it swings low
00:15:04.550 comes up swings down it comes up so yeah
00:15:08.270 we're gonna use the first swing high
00:15:10.370 daily levels right so all we're gonna do
00:15:13.399 is turn this red to mark it as daily
00:15:15.970 this is the swing high rate here and
00:15:20.170 this is the bottom side of that candle
00:15:23.029 oops wrong tool and this is the bottom
00:15:25.760 side of that candle so now we're going
00:15:27.079 to kind of walk through this to set up
00:15:28.490 for the next
00:15:29.059 part of this lesson which is if we
00:15:31.219 switch back trend reverse trend reversal
00:15:36.169 the psychology behind that and pattern
00:15:37.969 example so we've kind of been going over
00:15:39.589 pattern examples this whole time through
00:15:41.269 but let's talk about the psychology and
00:15:43.369 trend reversal and and the things that
00:15:44.869 happen and let's you know back this out
00:15:46.519 and look at this on a bigger scale now
00:15:48.379 with these a few of these trend lines in
00:15:49.909 place now before we start breaking this
00:15:52.789 down into the next part of this you know
00:15:56.209 these levels and and and and and what
00:15:58.249 we're doing here it's important that if
00:16:00.109 you guys haven't watched the previous
00:16:01.489 videos on accumulation distribution on
00:16:04.399 on support resistance on targets on all
00:16:07.519 those things that we talked about in the
00:16:09.019 past go and watch them now before before
00:16:10.729 you continue this video or before we
00:16:12.319 ended or you know watch this and then go
00:16:14.419 watch shows and watch this again or
00:16:15.499 whatever whatever order you choose the
00:16:18.169 reason being is that everything we build
00:16:21.379 on we build pieces based on what we've
00:16:23.869 learned so far okay so everything we're
00:16:25.909 talking about here you won't follow it
00:16:27.559 unless you've seen the videos in the
00:16:28.909 past and you have absorbed that material
00:16:31.189 and grasped dinner ok so let's kind of
00:16:34.669 walk through the psychology of this move
00:16:36.439 and we're gonna start that with a quick
00:16:38.779 overview cliff quick glimpse of the
00:16:41.569 weekly chart just to see let's take a
00:16:44.659 look we have a monthly level respected
00:16:47.989 there we have daily level respected
00:16:49.729 there we have trend respected there
00:16:51.079 right we have daily level respected
00:16:53.539 monthly broken to test at daily daily
00:16:56.509 broken to test a weekly right and we
00:16:58.309 don't even need this the bottom side of
00:17:00.739 this weekly level what we're going to
00:17:02.629 keep it but we don't need it for this
00:17:03.679 example then you can come up and see how
00:17:05.569 we test that monthly and regain that
00:17:07.939 monthly to regain the daily and so forth
00:17:09.769 so just as a quick oversight a few basic
00:17:13.009 trend lines you know this one was pretty
00:17:15.378 important here as it kind of dictated
00:17:16.789 this channel here and this one may have
00:17:19.730 been important here you know if we were
00:17:21.769 to do this to that swing high there
00:17:23.569 there may be some importance but I want
00:17:25.339 to keep the the chart is kind of as
00:17:27.499 simple as we can for this because we
00:17:28.999 don't we don't want to start cluttering
00:17:30.080 up too much and making too much of a
00:17:32.720 mess of it so what we're gonna do is we
00:17:34.369 are going to we're going to keep that
00:17:37.220 for nothing
00:17:37.750 I'm going to keep those local trend
00:17:41.059 lines that we you know what
00:17:42.320 we don't we don't really need them
00:17:43.429 because they're there to local they're
00:17:45.110 just showing right they're just showing
00:17:46.880 examples of how these trends start and
00:17:48.350 stop so let's walk through the
00:17:52.399 psychology of this okay
00:17:54.019 and then we're gonna get into something
00:17:55.100 pretty interesting about a head and
00:17:56.269 shoulders and patterns afterwards so
00:17:57.950 let's walk through the psychology of
00:17:59.090 this smooth you know we've identified
00:18:00.500 these trends and and and we've kind of
00:18:03.080 seen this and let's go to a daily chart
00:18:04.340 and look at what this thing is doing
00:18:06.370 right so we start kind of this uptrend
00:18:12.710 here and turn the magnet tool off and
00:18:14.899 and we come up and we test this level
00:18:16.669 and we come back down and we kind of
00:18:19.399 jump in and out of here and and you
00:18:20.840 notice that in this move right now we
00:18:23.210 are kind of testing this monthly break
00:18:25.340 that's a pretty important level that's a
00:18:27.889 monthly level think about that for a
00:18:30.139 second it's not a daily level didn't
00:18:31.549 take one day to make it's not a weekly
00:18:33.440 level didn't take one week to make it's
00:18:35.029 a monthly level it is a level that took
00:18:36.950 a month to make it is a very important
00:18:40.610 level so you can kind of see how many
00:18:43.250 times in this uptrend so we're in an
00:18:46.070 uptrend how many times this thing was
00:18:48.710 tested one two three four five six seven
00:18:51.620 almost every single day for how many how
00:18:54.110 many days we start here what was that
00:18:57.230 March 26 all the way up to April 10th so
00:19:03.169 so you've got I don't know how many days
00:19:04.639 are in March let's just say 30 and we
00:19:06.110 said the 26th of the 10 so you about 14
00:19:07.940 days where this thing almost tested it
00:19:09.649 every single date before it actually
00:19:11.210 broke a monthly level that is that is
00:19:13.909 powerful and that is why that broke
00:19:16.190 right so when we broke this this level
00:19:19.220 notice how we didn't just skyrocket
00:19:20.840 straight up because we are still
00:19:22.039 confined by other resistance levels you
00:19:25.159 see we are still confined by this trend
00:19:27.620 and this pattern we are still confined
00:19:29.480 by this trendline right we test it there
00:19:31.220 we test it here we test it here and then
00:19:33.230 we are still confined by a daily level
00:19:34.879 and let's let's go back for a second and
00:19:38.360 think about how long it took to break
00:19:39.559 the monthly level sorry my chart
00:19:41.929 disappeared on me their training is a
00:19:43.190 little wonky at times let's think about
00:19:44.840 how long it took to break that monthly
00:19:46.190 level right it took 14 days look at how
00:19:48.409 long it takes to break a daily level
00:19:49.700 right it takes one attempt two attempts
00:19:52.639 and then three on
00:19:53.549 third day and it broke it completely
00:19:55.980 broke through settlement you know to
00:19:57.269 kind of put an anchor to that idea of
00:19:59.009 how long it takes to break up monthly
00:20:00.269 level versus a daily you can see it
00:20:01.590 right here really it had to break two
00:20:04.080 forms of resistance but it had the
00:20:06.509 momentum of breaking that monthly level
00:20:08.970 right so it had to break two forms of
00:20:11.190 resistance before it can kind of take
00:20:12.480 this wrap and move up
00:20:14.070 okay now you know without getting too
00:20:18.210 too too far into this we're going to
00:20:20.039 come back and dissect this a little
00:20:21.299 later you know then you know let's look
00:20:24.690 at the psychology of this thing this
00:20:25.889 thing then acts as support you can see
00:20:27.570 it access support this whole way through
00:20:28.889 until it moves sideways enough you know
00:20:30.929 all's it had to do at this point was
00:20:32.159 move straight sideways they didn't have
00:20:33.960 to push the price down all they had to
00:20:35.759 do was hold it at the current level
00:20:37.080 right so so think about that for a
00:20:39.179 second if prices in this in this range
00:20:41.159 here and we are to move straight
00:20:42.690 sideways think about how easy it is to
00:20:44.549 dump down into that level and break down
00:20:46.200 into that all's people had to do was
00:20:48.629 hold a price if this was what was this
00:20:51.119 price here let's call it forty two
00:20:52.649 hundred SATs if this was forty two
00:20:54.539 hundred SATs right here they never had
00:20:56.309 to actually put downward pressure all
00:20:57.960 they had to do is continuously build up
00:20:59.700 these walls that would eventually by not
00:21:03.600 allowing the price to go up it would
00:21:05.129 eventually break back into this and and
00:21:07.049 lose that right so an important thing to
00:21:10.080 know about trends and patterns is is how
00:21:11.669 you get in and out of them do that
00:21:13.230 sideways motion sometimes right and and
00:21:15.509 then so now the psychology we're in this
00:21:17.129 trend line here and we're in support
00:21:19.230 resistance and the same thing here all
00:21:20.639 they had to do is push the price
00:21:21.659 sideways and hold the price at one level
00:21:23.190 before it breaks down right so now let's
00:21:26.850 walk through this know if you remember
00:21:28.379 in the next or starting up the next
00:21:30.359 video how would you know what's the next
00:21:31.529 video if you remember the last video
00:21:33.210 about offsetting momentum and how levels
00:21:38.489 offset momentum the same thing applies
00:21:40.859 to trends and patterns because those are
00:21:42.239 levels of support resistance - right so
00:21:44.489 you can see here momentum gets offset it
00:21:47.279 moves down right momentum then gets
00:21:49.529 offset again by testing this monthly
00:21:51.809 level it gets offset to test up right
00:21:55.139 that upwards momentum and that motion
00:21:57.749 gets offset by testing this trend line
00:22:00.779 or this pattern right it then gets
00:22:03.509 offset it comes down touches this level
00:22:05.820 it then off
00:22:06.720 there comes up tries to break again
00:22:09.120 offsets by that level so you can see how
00:22:11.850 even though we have our levels of
00:22:13.530 support resistance right there there is
00:22:16.020 still that offset against you have your
00:22:18.299 levels your swing high and lows but you
00:22:20.309 also have trends in patterns and those
00:22:21.809 are levels as well so it's very very
00:22:23.820 important and you can see as I'm walking
00:22:25.380 through this thing and you know we're
00:22:26.940 just gonna fast-forward through it a bit
00:22:28.289 here and not you know dissect it too
00:22:30.270 much further because it's gonna be the
00:22:31.380 same thing over again you know
00:22:33.179 resistance resistance support right same
00:22:39.059 thing resistance and support levels and
00:22:41.400 trends okay so there is something else
00:22:47.070 that happens okay
00:22:48.990 the psychology of these these patterns
00:22:53.570 okay and we're gonna take these trend
00:22:57.000 lines off for now they are gone for the
00:22:59.880 rest of the video we don't we don't need
00:23:01.230 them at this point anymore we're gonna
00:23:02.880 leave this one up as kind of an example
00:23:05.460 you guys have seen all your trading
00:23:09.570 careers oh we got one more let's delete
00:23:11.640 that you guys have seen all three
00:23:13.169 trading careers people creating these
00:23:16.220 valleys like this right let's go to the
00:23:20.250 daily chart it might be a little easier
00:23:21.570 to see oh look another one don't leave
00:23:24.360 that you you guys can see these valleys
00:23:28.470 that are created right we're gonna kind
00:23:30.480 of move it towards that trendline would
00:23:31.860 because we already know where that trend
00:23:32.970 line is right we've already identified
00:23:33.900 it so let's move it to that trendline
00:23:36.150 you've got this valley here created
00:23:37.919 right and how it lines up these valleys
00:23:43.200 these valleys that you create and you
00:23:45.270 see on charts you need to understand
00:23:47.070 something very specific and these
00:23:48.480 valleys are not being created because
00:23:50.970 they're they're you know being
00:23:52.350 identified as a valley that you can see
00:23:54.390 here right we went over this kind of
00:23:56.340 briefly in a video before this valley is
00:23:58.049 identified when you have a swing high
00:23:59.610 here this valley is nothing but the hard
00:24:01.230 left edge and the hard right edge of jof
00:24:02.850 trend lines that's all these are right
00:24:04.710 they are acting off support as the base
00:24:07.260 and they are the hard left edge and the
00:24:08.850 hard right edge just like right here you
00:24:11.700 know we have kind of this valley right
00:24:14.159 here right well let's take a look at
00:24:16.950 this for a second
00:24:18.200 all this was and we already drew this
00:24:20.570 one time so I'm not going to get too
00:24:22.880 much into it
00:24:23.750 oops wrong one too much into perfecting
00:24:25.970 this but okay I'm having a bit of
00:24:28.400 trouble here let's let's start over
00:24:32.299 you know this is this valley here okay
00:24:34.970 let's grab the right tool this time you
00:24:36.260 know we did the swing low here and we
00:24:38.450 saw that there right or you know and
00:24:41.120 then we kind of copy and drag that up
00:24:43.429 and it created you know this this valley
00:24:47.240 here right and the hard right edge right
00:24:50.780 here right that hard edge right there
00:24:53.120 and this trend line right here right
00:24:57.980 this okay so I guess for this one it
00:25:00.410 won't be what we create in the past
00:25:02.270 right because we actually got that's my
00:25:03.679 mistake we use the swing low and create
00:25:05.240 an uptrend that would have been been the
00:25:06.650 hard left edge the hard left edge would
00:25:08.660 have just been the swing high to the
00:25:09.679 swing high one swing high to the next
00:25:11.390 swing high and you can see it creates
00:25:13.100 the exact same same thing that we see in
00:25:14.600 valleys right it creates the exact same
00:25:18.940 component the exact same parameters of a
00:25:21.230 valley it just creates a hard left on
00:25:22.700 hard right edge this isn't really a
00:25:23.780 valley okay it is but realize that the
00:25:27.200 importance of the valley is the trend
00:25:28.429 lines okay so there there is something
00:25:35.540 interesting that happens in in in
00:25:38.720 markets and in traders and they have
00:25:41.780 this thing called head and shoulders and
00:25:43.040 I've seen they've seen a lot I've seen
00:25:45.940 head and shoulders I've seen the Batman
00:25:48.650 I've seen you know you have different
00:25:52.070 patterns and they you know oh it's doing
00:25:53.419 what's called the Bart and it's gonna
00:25:54.919 move down here and it's gonna move down
00:25:56.299 there because it's creating a Bart like
00:25:57.559 Bart Simpson the top of his head or it's
00:25:59.750 creating this head and shoulders or cup
00:26:03.110 and hand alright like this right here oh
00:26:05.120 this is classic captain handle were
00:26:08.120 destined to move up right so something
00:26:11.990 you guys have to understand none of
00:26:13.190 those things are real they don't they
00:26:14.390 are just ideas that people use because
00:26:17.960 they don't truly understand the science
00:26:19.760 of trading and they don't truly
00:26:20.720 understand support and resistance they
00:26:22.850 don't they don't they haven't quite
00:26:24.710 caught on to why a move is doing what
00:26:27.050 it's doing it's not a move is not moving
00:26:29.330 up because for some arbitrary
00:26:31.210 at this point here they said we're gonna
00:26:34.240 create a rounded bottom with another
00:26:36.580 little rounded bottom that's going to
00:26:38.170 look like a cup and a handle like a
00:26:39.400 teacup or I've got a coffee cup and it's
00:26:41.140 a cup and handle and it's going to
00:26:43.840 create this this this abstract pattern
00:26:45.940 where we're moving up I'm going to show
00:26:46.990 you guys something pretty pretty cool
00:26:49.120 and you guys will be able to follow
00:26:50.230 along because again you guys are smart
00:26:51.940 and you you get it now right so let's
00:26:55.870 take a look great here we have a swing
00:26:57.160 high here okay we went to pass the level
00:26:59.980 we established our first touch here and
00:27:03.880 we would pass a level that's why we're
00:27:05.740 moving up not because it's forming a cup
00:27:07.240 and handle and why did it find its base
00:27:09.190 down here and why did it create this
00:27:11.320 rounding out because it found an
00:27:13.060 accumulation zone back here off a weekly
00:27:15.640 level this isn't a cup and handle it
00:27:17.970 there's no such thing this is this is
00:27:20.620 just a quick graphic or a quick way
00:27:22.840 almost like a a kind of a cheat tool
00:27:25.330 that doesn't really work that people use
00:27:27.340 to identify all this move may be moving
00:27:29.200 up let's look at the most famous one
00:27:31.690 head and shoulders because this one I
00:27:32.980 always I always enjoy doing this there's
00:27:34.560 there was a classic head and shoulders
00:27:36.970 pattern in basic attention don't give a
00:27:39.310 nice I saw hundreds of traders saying
00:27:41.650 this move is going down because it's in
00:27:43.240 head and shoulders and will drop the
00:27:44.590 head and shoulders are gonna play along
00:27:45.640 right left shoulder here very basic we
00:27:50.290 need to turn the magnet to a loft where
00:27:51.400 this is gonna get really really funky
00:27:53.260 okay
00:27:54.630 left shoulder here right head right here
00:27:58.260 okay right shoulder here okay let's just
00:28:04.690 drag this not to complete that classic
00:28:07.450 head and shoulders pattern and oh look
00:28:09.430 at that we move down head and shoulders
00:28:12.160 before the dump this is dumping because
00:28:13.720 we're forming head and shoulders let me
00:28:14.950 tell you guys something okay this right
00:28:17.530 here when this happened there was not
00:28:20.560 some magical three valley play that
00:28:24.370 people had made up and said well lookit
00:28:28.870 guys we could create a head and
00:28:30.310 shoulders here so let's cumulative Lee
00:28:32.410 as the market together let's all see
00:28:34.210 this pattern from back here and let's
00:28:36.580 create three valleys where one valley is
00:28:38.500 small and then the middle Valley is
00:28:40.120 going to be the biggest valley and then
00:28:41.230 the right valley can be some arbitrary
00:28:43.060 in between small Valley all the way up
00:28:45.850 to somewhere that's not quite as big as
00:28:47.440 the head and then it creates as head and
00:28:48.880 shoulders in this great pattern let's
00:28:51.580 leave that up there and let's dissect
00:28:52.540 this move with the knowledge we know so
00:28:54.100 far okay this this pattern in this trend
00:28:56.350 and I love doing this because it's an
00:28:58.240 eye opener for so many people that these
00:29:00.010 patterns and trends and charts that
00:29:01.930 people are seeing they don't they don't
00:29:03.730 make sense they're not real it's it's
00:29:06.430 what people are using because they're
00:29:07.690 not understanding the true science of
00:29:09.580 why something is happening right because
00:29:11.380 they only see this move at this point
00:29:12.490 and they're like uh head and shoulders
00:29:13.750 it's dumping no let's let's talk about
00:29:15.430 this okay
00:29:17.370 these silver lines are monthly levels we
00:29:19.960 already know that okay we come up let's
00:29:23.110 even take it further back okay we right
00:29:26.170 here come up above this monthly level in
00:29:28.450 the attempts to try to touch and
00:29:31.210 establish a first touch on the next
00:29:33.580 monthly level it fails and doesn't
00:29:35.620 happen okay so let's go to where this
00:29:37.600 head and shoulders starts okay we need
00:29:39.640 to know that this move didn't have
00:29:41.410 enough momentum to reach this okay so if
00:29:44.110 it's not reaching one monthly level
00:29:46.090 what's it gonna do it's gonna touch down
00:29:47.500 to the next monthly level that it that
00:29:49.000 started in right it's there's there's
00:29:50.200 two monthly levels there's the top side
00:29:52.390 and the bottom side and if it just
00:29:54.040 traveled through the bottom side but
00:29:55.300 can't reach the top side guess what it's
00:29:56.560 going to touch that bottom side again so
00:29:58.720 right here we touch the bottom side of a
00:30:00.700 monthly level we know that that levels
00:30:03.370 gonna offset momentum so what's gonna
00:30:05.050 happen right we are touching this
00:30:06.670 monthly level at this point right here
00:30:08.200 we know that we need to use that
00:30:10.600 momentum that offset momentum to touch
00:30:12.430 up here to touch this level right here
00:30:14.200 the next monthly level very simple ABC
00:30:17.050 one and two monthly level monthly level
00:30:19.330 so we use that momentum to offset and
00:30:21.430 again if you don't if you don't
00:30:22.420 understand momentum offsetting go and
00:30:23.980 watch the previous video on I think it
00:30:27.520 was a lesson the most previous one less
00:30:29.740 than five I believe if it's not it's
00:30:31.300 number four or so it's one of those
00:30:32.770 anyways we touch this level the next
00:30:35.940 trajectory is up here to touch this
00:30:38.560 monthly level somehow we come down we
00:30:40.720 bounce off a daily level offsetting the
00:30:43.480 downwards momentum in the hopes that we
00:30:45.520 can establish a first touch of this
00:30:48.010 monthly level it doesn't happen well
00:30:50.920 what's going to happen next think about
00:30:52.510 it for a second if we have touched this
00:30:54.130 level once what do you end up doing in a
00:30:56.050 move
00:30:56.350 you establish first touch followed by
00:30:59.200 first test first touch is getting
00:31:01.180 rejected 90% of the time because it's
00:31:03.160 the first time it's touched the level
00:31:04.600 right here is first touch right that is
00:31:08.020 very important we don't first touch the
00:31:10.060 level above so what are we doing we're
00:31:11.560 immediately we immediately know that
00:31:13.210 when we lose this when we lose this
00:31:16.660 right here and we can't gain a new high
00:31:18.400 we are going to go down and test that
00:31:20.140 monthly level again so look what happens
00:31:21.910 we come down that momentum offsets off
00:31:24.550 the daily we come back up before we end
00:31:27.370 up taking our first test of this level
00:31:30.670 we establish the first touch here we
00:31:32.590 establish first test here that wicks the
00:31:35.590 level there is not enough support at
00:31:37.780 that level to hold it it wakes it and we
00:31:40.240 know we're moving down right and what
00:31:42.520 happens we move down until we hit this
00:31:44.800 point where we get offset by a weekly
00:31:46.990 level we want we just hit down on a
00:31:48.820 monthly level it's gonna take more than
00:31:50.170 a daily level to offset it right the
00:31:52.060 level strength is important here another
00:31:54.730 another lesson for another video the
00:31:56.890 weekly level offsets it we then come
00:31:58.660 back up and we break over it again
00:32:00.880 possibly now establishing another
00:32:03.300 potential Head & Shoulders pattern right
00:32:06.370 potentially establishing you see why
00:32:08.530 this looks familiar right because look
00:32:10.330 what happened over here we broke above
00:32:12.040 it and then we came back down to try to
00:32:13.780 set up another test on this level we
00:32:15.400 have not tested this level yet if we
00:32:18.100 look at the grand scope of things right
00:32:20.260 let's delete all these funny arrows for
00:32:23.200 now okay I know this always takes me a
00:32:26.050 second I wish there's a way to uh but if
00:32:27.490 I you know control Z and back it up it
00:32:29.620 kind of gets a little funny and charts
00:32:31.090 start deleting and trading view is not
00:32:34.680 it's it's a web app right it's not it's
00:32:37.210 not a a third-party app on my computer
00:32:40.210 so it's it's a little funny oops
00:32:43.620 right so let's delete all of this so we
00:32:48.580 know and we're gonna leave this one
00:32:50.320 because that was you know a test that
00:32:51.850 hasn't been touched we know we have
00:32:54.280 created a high here this is a pattern
00:32:56.050 right we know that we've created a high
00:32:58.000 here we need to establish the first test
00:33:00.790 of that our sorry the first touch of
00:33:03.490 this we didn't actually establish a
00:33:04.930 first touch so in basic attention token
00:33:07.360 what's going to
00:33:07.880 than York we bought potentially make a
00:33:09.350 head and shoulders pattern that you know
00:33:11.240 touches this level and then completely
00:33:12.710 rejects and does some other thing or
00:33:14.809 what's going to happen we don't know but
00:33:16.070 we know the goal is to establish a first
00:33:18.590 touch up here before we can actually go
00:33:21.080 through a first test so we are not you
00:33:24.860 know for some reason or another creating
00:33:27.919 a head and shoulders or some kind of
00:33:30.500 pattern that you know we can't possibly
00:33:32.390 know exists we are just simply following
00:33:34.010 levels right and another example of that
00:33:36.679 is people are you know they used cup and
00:33:38.600 hand want a cup in hand it looks like
00:33:39.890 this it's kind of this rounding bottom
00:33:41.659 which is which is the cup and then it
00:33:43.520 kind of has the handle on the cup right
00:33:45.350 kind of like a tea cup right like if you
00:33:46.909 were to draw this here like that like it
00:33:49.159 would be a tea cup right or whatever you
00:33:53.000 guys got a cup and handle right well
00:33:54.590 look what happens here this dictates
00:33:56.240 that that move is going up and you know
00:33:57.530 why cup and handle dictates that move is
00:33:59.990 going up because look at you've what
00:34:03.140 does this look like what we just talked
00:34:04.429 about level gets established which is
00:34:06.740 right here level gets established come
00:34:08.750 down we establish first touch on this
00:34:12.080 right first touch which was supposed to
00:34:14.090 be here then we move above it are we
00:34:16.850 really creating a cup and handle for
00:34:19.429 some arbitrary reason of this object
00:34:22.489 from life or or we simply just we simply
00:34:27.290 just have a swing high we've established
00:34:29.239 first touch and then first test can
00:34:31.668 break it what makes more sense here does
00:34:33.320 it make more sense that we are using
00:34:35.619 right the cup and handle or the head and
00:34:38.149 shoulders or does it make more sense
00:34:39.350 that these are levels and the science of
00:34:41.179 why things happen and the exact reason
00:34:42.800 as to why these patterns exist and what
00:34:44.510 happens I'll leave you guys to make that
00:34:46.550 decision I hope I hope the clarity that
00:34:49.550 I've given in this video can make that
00:34:51.800 decision an easy one for you and you can
00:34:53.300 kind of see that these patterns are
00:34:55.520 nothing but okay come on okay I can't
00:34:58.609 grab it okay
00:35:03.360 I have a feeling that I could
00:35:05.670 potentially be at this for a few hours
00:35:06.900 no I got it good it's like you know old
00:35:10.260 man syndrome getting older you know when
00:35:12.120 things aren't quite lining up anymore
00:35:13.320 I'm not bad all them get you know
00:35:15.030 mid-thirties it's not important it's not
00:35:20.070 all bad syndrome just whatever anyways
00:35:23.520 so you know really what makes more sense
00:35:25.650 here are we creating these abstract
00:35:27.840 patterns or people using these abstract
00:35:30.150 patterns as justification because I
00:35:31.590 don't quite understand what's happening
00:35:32.970 in the move I'm gonna leave it at that
00:35:36.930 at this lesson I think we covered quite
00:35:38.490 a bit and let's go back to our list here
00:35:41.370 we covered wire Pat what are patterns
00:35:43.080 you guys know what they are why are they
00:35:44.790 so important you can see why they're so
00:35:46.020 important now going to this video the
00:35:47.160 grand scope of things pattern
00:35:48.900 identification how to identify them you
00:35:51.000 know you've got the first swing height
00:35:52.230 to the next swing higher the first swing
00:35:53.730 load to the next swing low and you just
00:35:55.140 simply draw in a straight line it's just
00:35:56.640 the trendline very basic and I'm gonna
00:35:59.550 go through that one more time it you
00:36:00.960 know just in case people don't have
00:36:02.070 questions about ok how do i how do I do
00:36:03.540 this ok we're on a daily chart and you
00:36:06.510 know just just to you know go through it
00:36:08.220 one more time really quickly where was
00:36:11.400 one that we used we use this right here
00:36:13.200 so how I identified this one here from
00:36:15.690 earlier in the video all's I did well
00:36:18.990 that's a justice of it so we people can
00:36:20.700 see it a bit easier all's I did was at
00:36:22.620 the start of this move so you see how
00:36:24.330 this move is starting to move up I've
00:36:25.920 taken the first swing low right and it
00:36:28.530 makes a swing high before it comes down
00:36:30.840 to its next swing wow this wasn't the
00:36:32.190 swing low because it didn't finish going
00:36:35.010 down lower this was it right here but it
00:36:37.380 could have been the next candle down
00:36:38.580 here or whatever so all's I'm doing is
00:36:40.110 taking that swing low and one swing low
00:36:43.020 to the next swing level or one swing
00:36:47.250 high to the next swing high so we have a
00:36:49.590 swing high here the move kind of comes
00:36:51.390 down curves out and it has a swing right
00:36:54.090 there so I'm taking that so I'm high and
00:36:56.220 I'm lining it up there right so this
00:36:57.900 swing and then that's the swing and then
00:36:59.730 it acts as support so just just to
00:37:01.650 identify one last time that in case you
00:37:04.500 guys don't don't know how to identify
00:37:06.060 you know these these trend lines it's
00:37:08.190 it's swings to swings either low or high
00:37:10.940 trend reversal and the psychology behind
00:37:13.800 that and how these trends reverse and
00:37:15.660 how they
00:37:16.130 right these lines and pattern examples
00:37:18.410 and kind of going through you know going
00:37:21.740 to going through why these patterns
00:37:23.060 exist in and and you know them in real
00:37:25.250 time so that's it beginners course part
00:37:28.310 six patterns I hope you guys enjoyed it
00:37:30.050 learn something don't forget to

00:00:19.920 post up my trades there daily and my
00:00:21.869 content and scheduling and so forth so
00:00:24.330 yeah let's get right to it
00:00:25.289 all right what are wedges wedges are
00:00:30.019 kind of the kin to trends we learned
00:00:34.860 about trends in the last video and how
00:00:36.750 kind of these trend lines like this form
00:00:40.260 support resistance and if you haven't
00:00:42.149 watched the last video on patterns it
00:00:44.940 discusses patterns and trends it would
00:00:47.010 be pretty important that you do so at
00:00:48.750 this point just because you're gonna
00:00:49.860 need to know that material before kind
00:00:52.860 of fully understanding what wedges are
00:00:54.719 and how they have a kind of play
00:00:56.340 together and the role they share right
00:00:58.920 so we talked last video about trends and
00:01:03.809 patterns and how patterns kind of appear
00:01:06.479 all the time in in the charts and they
00:01:08.909 repeat themselves and what does what
00:01:10.979 does are kind of the same thing wedges
00:01:12.330 are like I said they've akin to trend
00:01:15.869 lines because what they are basically is
00:01:17.670 trend lines with tops and bottoms right
00:01:19.560 so something like this right would be a
00:01:26.460 wedge you you guys kind of see these all
00:01:29.220 the time they are on charts all the time
00:01:32.460 they're labeled as valleys as Peaks
00:01:34.610 descending which is descending wedges
00:01:36.810 bear flights both flights all sorts of
00:01:40.200 different terminology for wedges and
00:01:41.939 really the important thing about wedges
00:01:43.439 is not you know remembering the 20 or 30
00:01:46.409 different types of wedges there are you
00:01:47.880 know you remember that this type of
00:01:50.520 ascending wedge maybe has a certain
00:01:52.799 pattern that it that it goes by and and
00:01:55.200 because it's ascending its gonna break
00:01:58.439 out a specific way and you know you can
00:02:00.630 you can kind of break your brain almost
00:02:03.119 trying to figure out all these 20 or 30
00:02:05.759 different patterns that there are and
00:02:09.060 kind of trying to build this muscle
00:02:13.290 memory
00:02:13.620 of patterns with wedges but really
00:02:15.930 that's not going to do you any good
00:02:16.890 because wedges are simply just trend
00:02:18.480 lines right why does our simply just
00:02:20.659 these these creations of trend lines
00:02:23.310 right when you have something like this
00:02:25.980 where you have you know the swing high
00:02:28.409 of a move to the next one I have a move
00:02:30.569 or you know down here
00:02:33.030 swing low of a move to the next swing
00:02:35.549 low moving in these trend lines and
00:02:37.200 patterns so the important part about
00:02:39.750 wedges before we get into going through
00:02:42.530 discussing what they are is is is to
00:02:44.579 just kind of let go of all the patterns
00:02:47.879 and all the memory recognition you guys
00:02:50.310 have built up from this point on because
00:02:51.720 we are gonna understand the wedge
00:02:53.040 differently we are gonna understand the
00:02:54.780 science of the wedge and why moves
00:02:56.970 happen within wedges and so so take it
00:03:01.109 out of your brain and put it you know
00:03:02.310 take it out of your mind destroy that
00:03:03.890 catalog of ideas you have about wedges
00:03:06.390 and memorizing the patterns and all
00:03:08.010 these things like that it's not gonna do
00:03:11.280 you any good right we are gonna
00:03:13.230 understand wedges and and how they
00:03:16.970 function on the charts instead of trying
00:03:20.519 to memorize patents who's memorizing a
00:03:22.139 pattern isn't gonna do anything for you
00:03:23.609 guys
00:03:23.790 so what purpose do wedges serve so I'm
00:03:27.480 going to bring up one of the charts that
00:03:30.599 I did now this was self key and misses
00:03:33.480 entry I gave on my training view account
00:03:36.650 when was this this was on October 18th
00:03:40.889 by the looks of it yeah on October 18th
00:03:42.690 so uh so I identified a wedge that was
00:03:46.109 in key and the purpose of a wedge is
00:03:49.739 wedges show you the same thing trend
00:03:52.079 lines do to a point they show you kind
00:03:54.120 of trend reversal or a breakout of a
00:03:55.859 move happening when when a wedge breaks
00:03:57.750 when a long term wedge breaks they show
00:03:59.760 you a breakout of a move so you know
00:04:01.410 it's either gonna break up or it's gonna
00:04:02.579 break down right so the purpose of
00:04:05.489 wedges are to see kind of these boiling
00:04:08.819 points where accumulation or
00:04:10.709 distribution is happening and this
00:04:12.720 boiling point of where once this wedge
00:04:14.549 breaks this move is being forced in a
00:04:16.560 direction so let's just hit play here
00:04:18.959 and and see how this went out so when I
00:04:21.750 posted this up on trading let's see
00:04:23.250 playing and see how this trade played
00:04:25.260 out
00:04:27.280 I'm gonna turn this off whoops let's
00:04:30.800 bring that back up let's hit play here
00:04:36.670 so you can see that this was quite a
00:04:40.970 quite an insane move on key and the
00:04:43.340 reason being is it broke out of this
00:04:44.930 wedge and once it had the power and the
00:04:46.610 momentum to break out of this wedge here
00:04:48.170 it just went on this round page up it
00:04:50.300 took this huge upswing and let's look at
00:04:52.460 entry down here when I signaled it so
00:04:54.200 entry down here would have been at 88
00:04:56.840 SATs okay and the top of this move was
00:05:00.290 at 154 SATs so let's say you got into
00:05:04.040 this late you got in at 90 cents and you
00:05:07.160 didn't quite sell the top maybe you sold
00:05:09.080 at 150 SATs maybe that was the level
00:05:11.240 that you chose from 90 to 150 is a 60
00:05:14.720 SATs on a 90 set point so you're talking
00:05:17.420 about a 66 percent gain on one-on-one
00:05:21.070 stock just because you were able to
00:05:23.600 identify a wedge and see the breakout
00:05:25.400 that it's gonna take after it breaks out
00:05:27.140 of that wedge you know even round down
00:05:30.320 even maybe you didn't make 66 percent
00:05:32.270 maybe you made even less maybe you made
00:05:33.700 just fifty percent fifty percent is
00:05:36.230 insane
00:05:37.160 fifty percent on one-on-one player one
00:05:39.950 coin or one stock or one trade fifty
00:05:42.290 percent is insane forty percent is
00:05:44.570 insane thirty percent twenty three
00:05:46.220 twenty percent even 10 percent is great
00:05:48.740 on on one trade so really understand
00:05:52.910 that that why just have a power to them
00:05:54.770 and the power of a wedge is they show
00:05:59.060 large moves in the market and if you can
00:06:06.200 spot them you you can you can almost
00:06:08.870 predict what's gonna happen based on you
00:06:11.510 know levels of support trend lines you
00:06:13.250 know all these things we learn in the
00:06:15.140 past all these pieces that we're
00:06:16.400 building upon you can almost predict the
00:06:18.200 outcome of these trades on a regular
00:06:20.570 basis so if you haven't watched the
00:06:22.520 videos that we've we've uploaded so far
00:06:24.890 that I should say that I've uploaded so
00:06:26.330 far less than one two three four five
00:06:28.910 and six it's paramount that you guys
00:06:31.130 understand those concepts in great
00:06:32.960 detail so like always we use every
00:06:35.600 lesson from the past
00:06:36.570 the blocks of the future just like
00:06:37.770 building a Lego castle or whatever the
00:06:40.500 Sun Castle or whatever kind of castle
00:06:42.480 you like to build that's what we're
00:06:44.130 doing here right so it's important that
00:06:45.240 you know that you focus on understanding
00:06:48.900 those concepts in great depth
00:06:50.700 because all these things that we teach
00:06:52.110 our context rich understand them in
00:06:55.350 great depth every time we go into one of
00:06:57.600 these new videos
00:06:58.230 okay so accumulation and distribution in
00:07:00.630 wedges let's go back to our charts so
00:07:07.920 there's an interesting thing about
00:07:08.700 wedges and trend lines and you see this
00:07:11.250 in trend lines as well and you know what
00:07:13.890 just serve the purpose of completing
00:07:15.630 trend lines right like when you have a
00:07:17.760 trend line say from this swing low to
00:07:20.250 this swing low right or you have you
00:07:23.550 know this this right here to this right
00:07:25.710 here you know these trend lines they
00:07:27.860 create your wedges right so actually it
00:07:31.590 would be whoops let's just pick this up
00:07:35.370 you know if you were to create this this
00:07:39.060 trend line here from this swing low to
00:07:41.130 this swing low and from this swing low
00:07:43.140 to this swing high right here right
00:07:46.290 basically all you're doing is creating a
00:07:47.790 wedge so these whoops
00:07:49.440 so these trend lines right all they do
00:07:52.170 is create wedges you see trend lines and
00:07:55.860 wedges are you start with trend lines
00:07:59.010 and your trend lines develop into wedges
00:08:00.900 and and trend lines are important
00:08:02.370 because why just gonna show you one part
00:08:05.160 of that support resistance and the trend
00:08:07.050 lines are going to show you another
00:08:07.860 another part of that support resistance
00:08:09.630 an example would be here right you know
00:08:12.150 that this is gonna act right as
00:08:15.740 resistance we know that this trend line
00:08:18.420 that goes up like this right once we
00:08:20.760 break under it
00:08:21.660 we know what's gonna act as resistance
00:08:23.310 so that's what the trend line comes into
00:08:24.780 play and that's where you need these
00:08:26.550 trend lines on your chart to kind of
00:08:27.900 continue on and that's a little
00:08:29.280 different than a wedge because a trend
00:08:30.780 line although a trend line in a wedge
00:08:32.460 share the same hard left and hard right
00:08:34.289 edge as you can see here right they
00:08:36.059 share the same hard left and hard right
00:08:37.229 edge the difference is a trend line is a
00:08:41.210 one infinite line that acts as support
00:08:44.520 and resistance as you move in this coin
00:08:46.830 right a wedge
00:08:49.180 shows where that's gonna break up so
00:08:51.640 it's a little different right and a
00:08:54.970 wedge also has a top side trend lines
00:08:57.340 don't have that top side they do but
00:08:59.140 right if you were to create this top
00:09:01.060 site here swing to swing trendline what
00:09:03.850 do you have you have a wedge so it's
00:09:05.920 easier to use the idea and the tool of
00:09:08.560 just creating these wedges because
00:09:10.270 wedges also for another reason why does
00:09:12.100 evolve right you have your trend lines
00:09:14.470 but why does it evolve as you make new
00:09:16.540 swing highs in new swing lows wedges
00:09:18.940 move with those swing highs and swing
00:09:21.820 lows right look you have a swing high
00:09:23.170 here
00:09:23.920 swing low down here so let's line it up
00:09:25.630 and see what happens right you have a
00:09:27.640 swing low swing high break out of the
00:09:29.770 wedge take a huge move up so that's
00:09:31.720 where trend lines and wedges differ a
00:09:34.210 bit is because a trend a trend line is
00:09:36.430 kind of this static force that sits
00:09:38.830 there on the chart as to where a wedge
00:09:41.470 is dynamic a wedge moves as as a coin
00:09:46.000 moves the the wedge moves right so I've
00:09:48.910 picked dent for this example because
00:09:50.590 I've had a couple people say to me that
00:09:54.570 you know there's these low you want to
00:09:57.940 call them penny stocks or these these
00:09:59.170 low liquidity coins or low value coins
00:10:03.970 like dent or dent is only a handful of
00:10:06.700 SATs right worth you know between this
00:10:08.410 range of 23 shots to 59 and people think
00:10:12.280 that because these are these penny
00:10:14.650 stocks we're gonna call them or these
00:10:16.000 low liquidity coins or low value they're
00:10:20.230 not low liquidity they're low value
00:10:21.520 that's a it's a mistaken term I use
00:10:23.560 their it's a low value coin because it's
00:10:26.770 a low value point people think that they
00:10:29.110 have kind of this ignorance to the
00:10:33.070 market or they ignore the market
00:10:34.600 completely because he buys and sells are
00:10:37.180 just so high because of the value and
00:10:39.280 the way the books are set up but it's
00:10:40.360 not I want to I want to show people that
00:10:42.520 that's not accurate and that these
00:10:43.960 charts still they still stay true even
00:10:46.720 to low value coins it's just being able
00:10:49.330 to spot that oh right so we are gonna
00:10:52.870 use dent for these examples okay an
00:10:56.680 accumulation and distribution let's
00:10:58.270 let's start building these wedges and
00:10:59.650 how are they different from
00:11:01.190 so we went over that so we kind of
00:11:02.329 skipped one and what happens on a wedge
00:11:04.339 break and accumulation and distribution
00:11:05.959 so that's what we're gonna go over here
00:11:07.690 so let's delete this and let's delete
00:11:10.940 this and start from the beginning okay
00:11:12.879 now we're gonna do something here we're
00:11:15.379 going to take this and we're going to
00:11:19.519 chop this chart right here right so we
00:11:22.490 can kind of walk through how about wedge
00:11:24.649 would be created okay so when you're
00:11:27.079 creating a wedge you know you're gonna
00:11:28.910 have the swing high of the move whoops
00:11:31.970 wrong tool you know you're gonna have
00:11:34.399 the swing high of the move here to the
00:11:36.769 next swing high right so you know you're
00:11:38.750 gonna have that there and you could even
00:11:41.449 you know pull it back to here it would
00:11:43.579 be the same thing or this swing low to
00:11:47.029 this swing high here you're gonna find
00:11:51.139 the relevant somewhere in there you're
00:11:53.269 gonna use a swing high to the swing high
00:11:54.709 and you'll see that's the relevance of
00:11:57.110 this so as we step forward in this chart
00:11:59.240 just like trendlines we know we have one
00:12:00.829 swing high to the next swing high right
00:12:03.129 so that's created right there
00:12:05.480 first we would have created on this and
00:12:07.310 then we would have found our new swing
00:12:08.449 high and we would have created there now
00:12:11.060 we are going to step through this right
00:12:13.459 we're gonna wait for our swing low right
00:12:15.920 looks like right there we have our swing
00:12:17.360 low so we are going to create from this
00:12:20.689 swing low that's started to move to that
00:12:22.910 swing low okay and we are going to wait
00:12:26.029 for the top side of this which is right
00:12:30.980 here so let's recap that rate here okay
00:12:37.910 at this point you would have known you
00:12:41.000 have your wedge right this is very
00:12:45.040 simple right you can see how all we're
00:12:47.809 doing is we're lining up our trend lines
00:12:49.100 and this would have been here as well
00:12:51.079 right that would have been something
00:12:53.569 like that all we're doing is lining up
00:12:55.880 our trend lines to the first swing level
00:12:59.149 which is right there so accumulation and
00:13:02.899 distribution how does this work with
00:13:04.129 wedges okay so
00:13:09.410 oops accumulation distribution you have
00:13:12.840 different zones in a wedge that are
00:13:14.910 accumulation and distribution the bottom
00:13:16.980 side of your wedge always acts as
00:13:19.550 accumulation and the top sides of your
00:13:22.020 wedge always act as distribution okay so
00:13:25.230 that is another spot where trends all
00:13:28.290 the way they are akin to wedges they do
00:13:30.600 share that idea of accumulation and
00:13:32.670 distribution of points these have three
00:13:34.680 points of accumulation and distribution
00:13:37.070 right so if you are to accumulate every
00:13:39.870 time this touches down on this wedge and
00:13:41.640 distribute every time it touches up on
00:13:43.650 this wedge you can see that you would
00:13:47.130 have had another accumulation right
00:13:48.240 there you would have a distribution
00:13:49.680 right here you would have had
00:13:50.640 accumulation right there and let's just
00:13:52.440 walk through a little bit oh looks like
00:13:56.850 we're trying to break the wedge so at
00:13:58.140 that point we would have probably gotten
00:13:59.430 out of the trade now there's there's
00:14:02.340 something else to know that's very
00:14:04.650 important about wedges is that just like
00:14:07.680 trend lines they have kind of this
00:14:09.090 breaking point and and this is a really
00:14:11.790 important and advanced concept to
00:14:13.170 understand and it's not such a hard
00:14:15.180 concept to understand but it's very
00:14:16.350 important in training is that in these
00:14:19.500 wedges right you know that if you break
00:14:21.780 out of this top side you're gonna go up
00:14:23.160 if you break out of this bottom side
00:14:24.480 you're gonna go down or if you break out
00:14:26.040 through the middle you might enter
00:14:27.350 accumulation distribution whichever one
00:14:30.030 it ends up being for other reasons and
00:14:31.620 and you know you have a direction that
00:14:34.020 this is gonna go off this wedge and
00:14:35.760 typically it's gonna be up or down it's
00:14:37.350 it's it's it happens but it's pretty
00:14:39.780 rare that you you go straight sideways
00:14:41.720 so something that's very interesting
00:14:43.800 about wedges is it let's just put a line
00:14:46.020 here right let's mark out some levels
00:14:49.080 because I'm having a feeling this is
00:14:50.550 going to correspond pretty well so we've
00:14:52.080 got the daily levels we're gonna turn
00:14:54.630 these to red we use red for the daily
00:14:57.060 right the swing low and the swing high
00:14:59.700 of the spoon okay and then we've got the
00:15:04.410 the magnitude one get it perfect and
00:15:08.160 we've got the next level which would be
00:15:10.500 the swing low here and the swing high of
00:15:13.800 that
00:15:14.770 whoops wrong one again do you swing high
00:15:17.230 of that and then the swing high of the
00:15:20.560 move there okay so within these levels
00:15:26.230 we can see instantly our wedge is
00:15:28.600 created off of that pretty basic now the
00:15:32.440 importance of having these levels here
00:15:33.850 is to understand that there there's
00:15:36.880 something unique that happens in wedges
00:15:38.800 and like I was saying before it's it's
00:15:40.720 it's it's an advanced understanding but
00:15:45.370 it is very important and crucial to know
00:15:48.480 why these break and and and all that has
00:15:51.640 to happen is this price has to move
00:15:53.440 sideways so let's think about that for a
00:15:55.209 second we don't actually have to if this
00:15:57.730 coin was gonna actually move down and
00:15:59.649 and and this coin was gonna take this
00:16:01.270 trajectory down through this wedge the
00:16:04.089 people who are wanting to see the price
00:16:05.770 go down here they're wanting to see it
00:16:07.209 go lower they don't have to push the
00:16:09.550 price down right they don't have to
00:16:11.170 constantly sell down they don't have to
00:16:12.910 constantly do that all they have to do
00:16:14.529 is sell at the current level until it
00:16:17.800 ends up breaking so it's a very
00:16:19.600 important thing to understand what trend
00:16:21.010 lines with wedges and as things are
00:16:23.470 progressing and you'll see where where
00:16:25.120 levels touch wedge levels touch levels
00:16:28.810 of support and resistance off daily
00:16:30.100 levels and you'll see these points where
00:16:32.140 it's forced almost into an axiom or a
00:16:34.779 point where there is no there there is
00:16:40.480 no reason for it to not rate that level
00:16:42.850 and what I mean by that is it just goes
00:16:44.050 straight sideways right so you can see
00:16:45.790 here as we step through this they don't
00:16:48.130 have to push the price down they don't
00:16:49.990 have to do this thing where they're
00:16:51.100 trying to smash the price down because
00:16:52.450 once enough time goes by this price is
00:16:56.560 just gonna naturally break thee they
00:16:58.089 just have to hold the price of it you
00:16:59.440 don't even need downward pressure on
00:17:00.850 this stock to break this price it it
00:17:03.399 just breaks because it ends up going
00:17:05.230 through the side of it right so let's
00:17:06.609 walk through this and see what happens
00:17:08.079 right so we are in this wedge right
00:17:09.910 right now we are seeing it's being
00:17:12.099 supported it tries to come up and break
00:17:14.829 the top side of this wedge to gain that
00:17:16.240 momentum and it looks like it rejects
00:17:17.770 off this level right here so it looks
00:17:19.780 like it doesn't quite touch that level
00:17:21.369 and it looks like it's gonna break out
00:17:23.109 sideways and if it breaks out sideways
00:17:24.429 you realize that this is going to act as
00:17:26.770 resistance then and if that
00:17:27.880 acting as resistance it's just gonna go
00:17:29.800 down right so what happens price that's
00:17:32.380 it goes down you see how it breaks out
00:17:34.180 of the side of this wedge and it rides
00:17:35.560 the bottom side of this wedge pattern
00:17:37.510 until it just breaks up sideways and and
00:17:40.300 just by naturally breaking sideways it
00:17:42.010 actually just breaks this level too
00:17:43.390 right so it just naturally breaks
00:17:45.220 sideways and forms undo a new set of
00:17:49.150 moves right so it actually just kind of
00:17:50.740 dumps there and then this is where
00:17:53.410 wedges get interesting as wedges
00:17:55.900 progress wedges are different from trend
00:17:58.120 lines like we said before right if this
00:17:59.980 was the trend line if the trend line was
00:18:02.140 kind of you know let's just I don't know
00:18:04.390 it doesn't matter which one I use a
00:18:05.350 swing low to this swing one here if that
00:18:07.150 is a trend line right a trend line to
00:18:09.370 the static element it stays in place
00:18:11.560 it does not evolve this does write a
00:18:16.090 wedge now has a new swing low it creates
00:18:18.610 a new wedge right this wedge is
00:18:20.980 constantly evolving right you see how it
00:18:23.350 stays right in the middle of that wedge
00:18:25.770 until it breaks that wedge and takes a
00:18:28.540 move up you see once that wedge breaks
00:18:30.970 it takes its move and at that point it
00:18:33.580 creates a swing low here or a swing low
00:18:36.970 here and a new swing high so this is
00:18:39.250 these wedges constantly evolve and as
00:18:41.830 they are evolving they are further
00:18:43.780 moving the coin right these are the
00:18:46.090 points as to where you will see action
00:18:48.820 in a coin happen is when these wedges
00:18:50.980 are being broken right it looks like
00:18:54.040 it's right there right you see this
00:18:56.050 wedge is broken and it's acting a
00:18:57.430 support not because it broke through the
00:18:58.870 top side of it right
00:19:01.500 drag this out let's see how this
00:19:03.520 continuously progresses right because
00:19:07.240 this is an evolving thing remember that
00:19:09.310 it gets supported by the wedge right it
00:19:12.550 goes into another one of these pinching
00:19:15.850 points or another one of these crosses
00:19:17.260 where these these wedge points the the
00:19:19.420 top and bottom right are acting as as
00:19:22.140 across and kind of the end of either
00:19:25.090 accumulation or distribution so let's
00:19:26.740 look at that for a second we know that
00:19:28.480 every time we touch the bottom of the
00:19:30.490 wedge its accumulation and every time we
00:19:32.650 touch the top of the wedge its
00:19:33.640 distribution right so the same theory
00:19:36.460 plays out here we accumulated here we
00:19:38.290 sold here
00:19:39.310 right just like we did over here just
00:19:40.990 like you do all the way throughout this
00:19:42.700 wedge as this wedge evolves you are
00:19:44.710 using those bottom touches as
00:19:47.670 accumulation every single time so if you
00:19:49.900 were to buy here have 30 sets and sell
00:19:52.420 here at 39 and this is something that
00:19:55.330 you could have very easily done take off
00:19:56.830 one side on either side to it to say you
00:19:59.650 know maybe you got late entry or wasn't
00:20:00.970 perfect or whatever 31 to 38 what is
00:20:03.700 that six at seven sets so you've got
00:20:06.190 seven sets on a 37 that's like twenty
00:20:09.220 two point something percent or twenty
00:20:10.690 twenty-three point three percent of
00:20:12.730 something like that
00:20:13.270 but you've got a 20% Plus plate because
00:20:16.450 all you did was basically accumulated
00:20:18.010 the bottom side of the wedge and
00:20:19.030 distributed the top side right so now
00:20:21.040 let's see where this goes after it
00:20:22.450 breaks out of our wedge again break so
00:20:25.810 and it actually doesn't do anything it
00:20:28.720 actually goes into accumulation so this
00:20:30.220 is this is kind of one of those rare
00:20:31.540 times now let's take this back to here
00:20:34.630 and continuously pull our wedge with us
00:20:37.870 right we are continuously pulling our
00:20:40.030 wedge to our new swing highs and swing
00:20:41.530 lows and this looks like it's one of
00:20:42.730 those times where it actually does enter
00:20:44.380 an accumulation of distribution point
00:20:46.410 possibly right we have no swing high-low
00:20:50.080 swing highs at all but right there we do
00:20:53.800 get a new loan right so then we would
00:20:58.600 drag this out to here right swing high
00:21:01.720 swing low right view it's not really a
00:21:04.690 swing high but it's the new kind of the
00:21:05.950 parameters of that wedge you have a new
00:21:10.480 swing high there so we can drag you know
00:21:12.010 we've got our swing low here that's our
00:21:13.540 new swing high so that's where that
00:21:15.010 wedge would have been right so now let's
00:21:17.320 see what happens here as we break out of
00:21:20.350 this wedge you can see in let's just
00:21:22.030 make sure this is lined up perfectly
00:21:23.200 because I don't want to get any any
00:21:26.200 information wrong here or any I want to
00:21:30.340 get this exact because again remember
00:21:31.660 this is like the science of training
00:21:33.220 what I teach is the science of trading
00:21:34.810 and why markets move the way they do and
00:21:36.160 the exact so what happens so just like
00:21:39.070 this whole move we know now if before we
00:21:42.010 go forth through this move because I
00:21:43.600 think you guys clearly see where this is
00:21:44.980 going before we go through this move
00:21:47.500 let's let's let's talk about
00:21:48.900 accumulation and distribution now let's
00:21:50.770 look at this picture as a whole because
00:21:52.060 we've kind of
00:21:52.570 analyzed it on a micro scale and zoomed
00:21:54.430 in and evolved this wedge and pulled it
00:21:56.470 out and done all that stuff that's
00:21:58.210 showing us what's happening in the
00:21:59.290 moment but now let's look at this on a
00:22:00.910 larger scale let's let's take our mind
00:22:03.010 frame out of looking at the day to date
00:22:04.420 and let's pull back to a month or two
00:22:06.400 and what has been happening okay what
00:22:09.040 does this look like to you guys this
00:22:10.810 looks like it went through an
00:22:12.270 accumulation zone right here it then had
00:22:15.460 a distribution zone right there and
00:22:17.230 right there right kind of to
00:22:19.630 distribution zones the very top and then
00:22:21.340 and then the tapering off distribution
00:22:22.780 zone let's delete this and we're gonna
00:22:27.040 draw a box okay if kind of this point
00:22:31.090 right here right if this point right
00:22:33.520 here ended up being accumulation right
00:22:39.180 if that point ended up being
00:22:41.140 accumulation right in red and let's make
00:22:43.390 this one let's do yellow for this one
00:22:47.020 and this ended up being a distribution
00:22:49.000 zone what does it look like we are doing
00:22:52.060 right now
00:22:53.100 forget the day-to-day stuff what does it
00:22:55.360 look like the movies been doing for the
00:22:57.130 entirety in this whole section here this
00:22:59.020 looks like accumulation textbook
00:23:00.640 accumulation with some small attempts to
00:23:03.670 move up and this looks like textbook
00:23:05.740 accumulation so let's let's let's
00:23:08.680 combine a few of these different
00:23:10.600 theories we have your accumulation what
00:23:12.370 happens after accumulation I move up
00:23:14.110 what happens after I move up
00:23:15.490 distribution we now have used
00:23:18.430 accumulation locally day to day and we
00:23:20.950 are now using it on a bigger time frame
00:23:22.570 on a bigger scale so now we are looking
00:23:24.790 at this wedge and saying while we're in
00:23:28.210 accumulation and there's only so long as
00:23:30.760 accumulation can go on before this wedge
00:23:32.770 finally decides to snap and give up okay
00:23:35.140 so let's see what happens now and you
00:23:39.070 guys have probably already know what's
00:23:40.210 gonna happen but just to tie in all
00:23:42.700 these theories together right comes
00:23:47.980 looks like it's trying to break out of
00:23:49.780 the wedge there it's a cumulation is it
00:23:52.630 happened all here well what's gonna
00:23:54.520 happen next
00:23:57.580 can he can't pick it up guys it's the
00:24:00.860 science of trading it so it's why things
00:24:02.750 happen in the market the second it
00:24:04.130 breaks out on the wedge off long-term
00:24:05.539 accumulation look what happens unless
00:24:08.690 further this move and see what happens
00:24:10.370 you know it tries to break this level it
00:24:13.279 establishes first touch first test right
00:24:17.690 has a retracement establishes another
00:24:21.799 test and then moves and look where it
00:24:24.409 stops it actually stops right on the
00:24:26.240 level so it actually stops right on the
00:24:28.250 level of where we were thinking which
00:24:30.830 kind of enters this distribution zone
00:24:32.630 that we had in the past
00:24:33.799 oh that's it okay so that that's where
00:24:37.220 we are in the move right now so you guys
00:24:39.500 can kind of see the difference between
00:24:41.690 trend lines and wedges because trend
00:24:43.190 lines are static but wedges evolve
00:24:44.570 wedges are trend lines but they were
00:24:46.279 evolving trend lines they are not the
00:24:48.529 static trend line they are the dynamic
00:24:50.450 trend line and the important concepts to
00:24:52.100 know with wedges is how to evolve them
00:24:54.880 what it means when they break right and
00:24:57.320 what that sideways break means and if we
00:24:59.330 just kind of drag through this again
00:25:00.950 right it would have been the swing high
00:25:04.460 to the swing low right
00:25:05.690 looks like swing high swing low right
00:25:09.340 creates a new one right there oh right
00:25:15.289 because we have this swing low here my
00:25:17.480 mistake
00:25:17.960 we have this swing low to that swing
00:25:19.639 high right at that point we created a
00:25:23.600 new swing low right so swing low to
00:25:26.000 swing high as it breaks out it goes up
00:25:28.279 and look what this ends up being an
00:25:29.659 accumulation zone from back here right
00:25:31.399 so as it breaks up it goes out we then
00:25:33.260 evolve our wedge from that swing low to
00:25:35.809 that swing high it breaks out it takes a
00:25:38.240 little move we then evolve it that swing
00:25:40.789 low to that swing high it comes up it
00:25:43.070 has kind of this last little bit of
00:25:44.929 failure creates a new swing low and a
00:25:47.539 new swing high there and then if finally
00:25:50.659 has its move after it's done its run an
00:25:53.120 accumulation so you can see how it
00:25:56.090 evolves and the importance of these
00:25:57.769 wedges and you know again just to go
00:26:00.169 over it maybe now you guys can can see
00:26:02.690 that the type of wedges you guys are
00:26:06.440 drawing and and you can look at these
00:26:07.970 charts online and you can understand pad
00:26:10.779 and and and and have this page where you
00:26:15.230 you have what does an ascending what you
00:26:16.999 look like what is a Bear Flag look like
00:26:18.409 what does a bull flag look like what is
00:26:19.820 it descending watch a falling rising
00:26:22.129 wedge a flagpole you can have all these
00:26:25.129 different forms of wedges you can have
00:26:27.739 all these different forms of trendline
00:26:29.330 and wedges but really the only thing
00:26:30.499 that matters in all of that that you see
00:26:32.509 is the tramlines and the wedges and all
00:26:36.080 the wedges are our dynamic trend lines
00:26:38.419 and all trend lines are static John
00:26:39.950 lines so really everything is trend
00:26:41.450 lines and in trend lines that's why we
00:26:43.429 call it patterns because wedges in trend
00:26:45.080 lines are patterns there are patterns
00:26:46.759 that happen over and over and over on
00:26:48.470 the market and you don't for like I said
00:26:50.570 destroy that mentality of I need to
00:26:53.509 memorize what an ascending wedge does
00:26:55.549 and and what it's going to do because
00:26:57.259 the mentality of all these wedges is
00:27:00.409 really just the hard edges and as we
00:27:03.169 were up here right this would have been
00:27:04.519 classified as your your your classic I'm
00:27:09.559 gonna move the screen over but so you
00:27:10.669 guys can see here this would have been
00:27:12.080 defined as your classic rising wedge but
00:27:14.440 what good is it doing you to to memorize
00:27:17.570 a pattern when you can understand why
00:27:19.999 something breaks it breaks because the
00:27:21.799 the price is being pushed sideways and
00:27:24.679 when it breaks that level of support
00:27:26.749 right this is support and that's why
00:27:28.100 it's bouncing bouncing bouncing bouncing
00:27:30.200 until a point where it either has to go
00:27:31.909 up or down right you can see it right
00:27:34.190 there you can see it has to it bounces
00:27:37.039 so many times it comes to this point
00:27:38.509 where it acts lutely has to break out of
00:27:40.519 the top and it tries it tries to break
00:27:42.590 out it fails it rejects off a level and
00:27:44.659 then alls it has to do is move sideways
00:27:46.940 and once it moves sideways it breaks you
00:27:49.190 don't need to memorize the pattern of
00:27:51.139 what's gonna happen because memorizing
00:27:53.299 that most of the time this ascending
00:27:55.609 wedge move sideways out of it is gonna
00:27:57.080 fall isn't gonna help you if this breaks
00:27:59.690 up because then what's gonna happen then
00:28:02.269 you're gonna have this break up and move
00:28:04.279 up like that it's not going to help you
00:28:06.019 because you've memorized one pattern but
00:28:07.789 really there's a certain amount of
00:28:09.559 dynamics that can happen within this
00:28:11.239 wedge right it can break up or to the
00:28:13.429 right the important part of
00:28:15.139 understanding wedges like I said it's
00:28:16.759 not pattern and memory recognition and
00:28:18.710 muscle memory of to what they do it's
00:28:20.539 understanding why the wedge is there and
00:28:23.359 and why something
00:28:24.750 is moving as it is right so very
00:28:27.960 important lesson in wedges you know and
00:28:31.950 then this is an ascending wedge and then
00:28:33.510 this is a different kind of wedge here
00:28:34.920 and you know it would have actually you
00:28:37.830 know been this here this swing low to
00:28:39.660 this swing high and then it you know
00:28:41.370 let's get it done properly okay
00:28:49.740 would have been like that it breaks out
00:28:52.080 of the wedge right all's it has to do is
00:28:53.400 move sideways and and it moves up right
00:28:55.980 you move it over again you know beating
00:28:58.050 this thing to be to the last pulp right
00:29:01.490 bottom side of the wedge top side of the
00:29:03.600 wedge breaks off the top side this then
00:29:06.000 access support it takes its move up it
00:29:08.250 gets rejected on another level comes
00:29:10.680 down here and is now trying to stay
00:29:13.320 above this level here so it just all
00:29:15.690 ties together trendlines patterns and
00:29:17.790 levels of support resistance of daily
00:29:19.230 levels weekly levels monthly levels of
00:29:20.790 stuff all ties together in a very
00:29:23.280 specific way so it's really the science
00:29:25.020 of things thank and what do we have left
00:29:29.160 what's examples well we went over that
00:29:31.020 but maybe let's quickly go over one more
00:29:33.000 on key because we because because I
00:29:36.840 brought that example up earlier where
00:29:38.160 this this this coin took this rapid move
00:29:41.490 on where was it the 18th is where I gave
00:29:44.790 entry so let's just cut it off at the 18
00:29:46.650 so let's kind of go through my mind
00:29:48.570 mindset and my process on this coin and
00:29:51.270 I have some Sun levels marked out
00:29:52.590 already
00:29:53.690 from before and you guys know that my my
00:29:57.270 strongest level here is my monthly level
00:29:59.430 which is the top side of the swing low
00:30:01.500 candle right so monthly is silver weekly
00:30:04.860 as purple daily is red just so you guys
00:30:06.870 can you know follow along quickly and
00:30:08.430 let's see kind of where I got that move
00:30:12.390 from and walk through my thought process
00:30:15.150 as if we were in the move stone right so
00:30:17.880 we are going to cut this off bring our
00:30:20.190 replayer back up pick our candle tool
00:30:24.090 and go to the 18th because that's where
00:30:25.350 I gave signal cut it there okay
00:30:27.180 let's create this wedge so from the move
00:30:29.460 that started to move down to the swing
00:30:31.110 low right
00:30:32.179 we had the wedges here so let's walk
00:30:35.850 through this right this would have been
00:30:36.990 our first falling wedges they call
00:30:38.630 well look what happens falling wedge all
00:30:40.340 we have to do is hold price up we break
00:30:42.200 out sideways right classic example of
00:30:44.900 what a wedge does we break out sideways
00:30:46.880 it acts as support we move up let's find
00:30:50.059 a new swing high right new swing high is
00:30:52.549 there this is our swing low still our
00:30:55.309 new swing swing high is there wow look
00:30:56.990 what happens we move up we break down on
00:30:59.240 the bottom side this wedge Wow just like
00:31:00.919 clockwork or magic or whatever you want
00:31:03.140 to call it the science of trading is
00:31:04.789 what I call it you guys can call it
00:31:06.080 whatever you want
00:31:07.669 I've had some people in the disc or
00:31:10.070 channel say it's magic I just tell them
00:31:12.200 it's just the way things work it's the
00:31:13.970 science watch the videos you will
00:31:15.470 understand and be able to do this all on
00:31:17.360 your own and most of you already can you
00:31:19.460 guys are good traders you guys know
00:31:20.870 exactly what you're doing this just
00:31:22.100 helps you guys refine your skills and
00:31:23.720 put some of the things that you know to
00:31:25.789 bed and the idea so this you know whoops
00:31:28.840 going back to this swing high break the
00:31:32.270 bottom side of the wedge of course we go
00:31:33.650 down so now we have a new swing low here
00:31:35.120 so all we're gonna do is drag this out
00:31:36.950 and create our new swing low and our new
00:31:40.190 swing high so you can see this what has
00:31:41.659 actually evolved into into a few
00:31:43.429 different types of ideas throughout this
00:31:44.720 movement first it was a falling wedge or
00:31:47.240 a descending wedge oh sorry but first it
00:31:49.429 was a falling wedge now it's a
00:31:50.570 descending wedge so it would be okay
00:31:52.190 again whatever the type of wedges it
00:31:55.820 doesn't matter it's not it's not muscle
00:31:58.130 memory now let's go back to you before
00:32:00.890 we move in further into this what does
00:32:03.320 this look like here accumulation what
00:32:05.539 does this look like up here distribution
00:32:06.980 so we're gonna just mark this zone off
00:32:08.419 here as a kind of accumulation I will
00:32:10.610 just go to the way this swing low of
00:32:11.720 that candle was and we'll just kind of
00:32:15.380 mark out an area not that's not you know
00:32:17.450 the exact science of marking out
00:32:18.799 accumulation but that just gives you
00:32:20.270 guys an idea of that that's accumulation
00:32:21.890 there so we know that if this is
00:32:23.690 accumulating here after it's gone
00:32:25.280 through long term distribution if it's
00:32:27.620 accumulating on this level you know we
00:32:29.299 can use that as a pretty good indicator
00:32:30.530 and a pretty good strength with our
00:32:31.850 wedge to see what's going on we break
00:32:34.640 out sideways we take another move up
00:32:36.409 right so let's expand it further we
00:32:40.429 break out sideways we take another move
00:32:42.200 up you see let's expand this wedge like
00:32:45.230 that let's expand this wedge further and
00:32:48.380 this is where I gave entry
00:32:50.970 this wedge as its evolving we have a
00:32:53.430 swing high here right we have our swing
00:32:55.530 high this is a swing high too but this
00:32:57.180 is the the highest closing candle so I
00:32:59.100 use that and get into that in another
00:33:01.830 video for now just use the the swing
00:33:03.420 high of the highest closing candle so
00:33:07.500 you can see this is where I gave entry
00:33:10.110 on this coin and let's see what happens
00:33:12.590 kind of stays in between these levels
00:33:14.940 that we have here right and it's
00:33:16.800 probably not really gonna move and it's
00:33:18.870 it's it's not really gonna move until it
00:33:20.580 breaks out of this wedge right you can
00:33:21.720 see here it's kind of gaining momentum
00:33:22.800 and at this point let's let's zoom in
00:33:24.870 and look at this not only do we gain
00:33:30.350 well we don't technically we don't gain
00:33:32.850 this level but we are starting to close
00:33:34.200 over top of it we gain the wedge here
00:33:36.090 this is where we gained the wedge on
00:33:37.830 this candle we haven't gained this level
00:33:39.180 yet but we've gained the wedge that is
00:33:40.860 going to give us the momentum we need to
00:33:42.090 move up right let's see what happens the
00:33:44.400 next move just like magic the first
00:33:46.800 candle we close over this wedge look
00:33:48.720 what happens on the very next move on
00:33:50.730 the daily just like magic man the
00:33:53.790 science of trading boom it moves up and
00:33:58.230 it takes this rapid move up and now is
00:34:00.030 this just luck or was this accumulation
00:34:02.070 and distribution with the concept of
00:34:06.450 wedges right I'll let you decide I know
00:34:10.320 what it is I'll let you make your
00:34:11.370 decisions and then let's see what
00:34:12.840 happens right it's constantly going up
00:34:15.000 out of this wedge it's made its move it
00:34:16.710 retraces and and look what it does and
00:34:18.659 we identified a monthly level there
00:34:20.820 right that was a pretty important point
00:34:23.400 and we are all caught up so if we go
00:34:26.489 back to the monthly levels you know I'm
00:34:30.179 gonna always give you guys these
00:34:31.440 examples and you guys are going to
00:34:32.909 constantly see me go through this and
00:34:34.409 and just to hammer that point home of
00:34:36.750 levels of support and resistance and
00:34:38.340 wedges have an exact science this is the
00:34:41.130 reason that things happen there is no
00:34:42.840 guesswork there is no maybe the level is
00:34:44.670 here maybe the level is there no there
00:34:46.320 is one spot where that level it's it is
00:34:49.320 respected to the tee like 99% of the
00:34:52.440 time so we have a swing low candle and
00:34:55.770 unlike always we would take the top and
00:34:57.750 the bottom side of this let's mark off
00:34:59.670 the bottom side as well just for unity
00:35:02.070 in this
00:35:02.940 chart so we have the monthly low and the
00:35:05.700 monthly high level right and and it's
00:35:07.500 not every single month has a level it's
00:35:09.480 our swing high and lows right so and if
00:35:12.119 you're not grasping that just go go back
00:35:13.980 to the levels of support resistance
00:35:16.200 video and then it goes over it in great
00:35:17.730 detail and you can see that you go to
00:35:21.269 where we play and chop this back off
00:35:23.519 right here while we're in these levels
00:35:25.470 right after we've broken this wedge
00:35:27.450 while we're still in the levels right
00:35:32.250 after we retrace we gain the momentum
00:35:34.500 off the offset of you know we offset
00:35:36.660 momentum we gain that and look what we
00:35:39.059 do we touch the monthly level it's just
00:35:42.809 as simple as that guys just as simple as
00:35:45.420 that right and now it looks like we are
00:35:48.529 finding support off this daily level so
00:35:50.730 we'll see where key goes from here but
00:35:51.990 you know having entry at 88 cents
00:35:54.809 because you can see a wedge about to
00:35:56.069 break a long-term wedge about to break
00:35:58.079 that's been tested and kind of evolved
00:35:59.819 multiple times you know kind of the more
00:36:02.009 times a wedge evolves the more times a
00:36:04.950 wedge has to be pulled out and and and
00:36:07.109 and Reed you're on becomes this point
00:36:10.319 where every time you're evolving that
00:36:12.750 wedge it's becoming weaker I guess is
00:36:15.150 the best way to put it those support
00:36:16.559 resistance lines are becoming weaker so
00:36:18.569 every time you're pulling these wedges
00:36:20.339 out and every time it's tested it to
00:36:22.920 break and made a new swing high in a new
00:36:24.630 swing low or any type of swing movement
00:36:27.119 off the break of a wedge every time it
00:36:28.920 does that it kind of weakens the wedge
00:36:31.109 right almost think of it like first
00:36:32.849 touch first test second test all that
00:36:35.670 right it's the same thing it's testing
00:36:37.470 those ledges and we'll get into that in
00:36:38.640 a more advanced video but I think you
00:36:39.869 guys can see where that first touch
00:36:41.549 touch first test theory is starting to
00:36:43.890 come into play is you're you're touching
00:36:45.720 the level and it's becoming different
00:36:48.420 every time and it happens with wedges
00:36:49.740 and trends too right so let's quickly go
00:36:53.970 back over there over the list here and
00:36:55.589 see what we haven't covered okay what
00:36:57.599 are watches we know what Y does are they
00:36:59.819 are akin to trend lines and they end up
00:37:02.880 being kind of just the complete dynamic
00:37:05.549 trend lines versus the static trend
00:37:08.009 lines right static is your trend lines
00:37:09.450 dynamic is your wedges two different
00:37:11.099 things although they are the same
00:37:12.829 concept right swings two swings so
00:37:16.330 it's a pattern right you you can you can
00:37:18.040 lump that into one one concept patents
00:37:20.830 right
00:37:21.340 why does in trance patterns it's all
00:37:22.960 they are forget everything else you know
00:37:24.310 forget both likes pendants this that I
00:37:26.440 don't use any of that and you guys
00:37:28.300 shouldn't either because now you can see
00:37:29.770 all you need is levels and patterns and
00:37:32.740 that's it everything else is just quick
00:37:34.720 tools that people use you know who don't
00:37:36.190 who don't quite understand the the what
00:37:39.820 and why right what what purposes do what
00:37:42.700 to serve the dynamic movement of trend
00:37:45.100 lines accumulation and distribution and
00:37:47.050 wedges you can see that there's
00:37:48.070 accumulation and distribution and wedges
00:37:49.540 just like there was in levels than just
00:37:51.160 like there's an all charts how do they
00:37:53.590 differ from trend lines we answered that
00:37:55.480 one already what happens on a wedge
00:37:57.610 break as a wedge breaks it's it's
00:37:59.830 forcing a move it's forcing a point
00:38:01.450 where there's going to be action of some
00:38:03.970 type up or down based on how that wedge
00:38:05.860 is breaking and wedge examples we went
00:38:07.480 over I think in pretty good detail so I
00:38:09.670 think that's it for this one guys
00:38:11.920 this has been beginner's course part
00:38:13.420 seven on wedges follow the channel check
00:38:17.080 out the donations do all that fun stuff
00:38:18.460 we talked about in the beginning of a

00:00:00.200 hey everyone cotton candy TA here and
00:00:02.270 welcome to beginners course part 8
00:00:03.590 timeframes alright if you're enjoying

00:00:20.180 you haven't checked out the trading
00:00:21.230 video account or the Twitter I would
00:00:23.150 recommend you do so as I post up some
00:00:24.680 charts there that you guys can follow
00:00:25.850 along with my content release schedule
00:00:28.220 and just some different day-to-day stuff
00:00:29.420 that I'm doing in the trading world
00:00:30.490 alright without further adieu let's get
00:00:32.539 to it
00:00:34.360 okay what are time frames so quickly
00:00:37.570 just to identify for those of you who
00:00:39.040 may not know time frames are represented
00:00:41.379 by these candlesticks okay I'm on the
00:00:43.239 monthly chart right now I have you can
00:00:46.059 have weekly daily 12-hour whatever you
00:00:50.199 choose to use basically the way this
00:00:52.059 works is each candle stick here
00:00:54.150 represents your time frame so from the
00:00:56.650 12 hour chart this candlestick
00:00:58.659 represents the last 12 hours of price
00:01:01.629 movement the next one would represent
00:01:03.610 those 12 hours and so forth if I'm on a
00:01:05.770 weekly chart that would then switch over
00:01:07.270 and each candlestick would represent one
00:01:10.210 week of action or the weekly time frame
00:01:13.090 so just do identify for those of you who
00:01:15.670 don't know how it works that's what time
00:01:17.590 frames are okay let's go back here okay
00:01:23.020 why are time frames important to levels
00:01:24.640 time frames are important to levels
00:01:26.770 because they do you know the strength of
00:01:30.729 the level now before we go any further
00:01:33.100 I'm going to just make a quick mention
00:01:34.929 here there is a lot to know about time
00:01:38.530 frames time frames are a very basic
00:01:41.140 concept but hard to master time frames
00:01:43.479 become very important on every trade you
00:01:45.610 make for two reasons I'm not going to
00:01:49.209 get into all of the time frames and and
00:01:51.700 their implications in this video reason
00:01:53.229 number one is there wouldn't be enough
00:01:54.429 length in terms of the amount of time I
00:01:57.489 like to keep this content limited to
00:01:59.020 number two the the start of time frames
00:02:03.190 versus the end of time frames and
00:02:05.140 everything in between is a vast amount
00:02:06.759 of information people just learning
00:02:08.199 about time frames aren't gonna be able
00:02:10.360 to grasp from A to Z right there's
00:02:13.569 there's a marque of practice that you
00:02:16.150 need in there to follow along with some
00:02:19.150 of the more advanced concepts of time
00:02:20.349 frames and and and what it means when
00:02:22.120 they break in things like that so
00:02:24.000 they're still gonna be very valuable
00:02:25.959 information in here and there's gonna
00:02:27.790 there's still gonna be a lot of advanced
00:02:29.230 stuff in this lesson in part eight but
00:02:33.160 just not all of it because that will be
00:02:34.750 for an advanced course okay so
00:02:39.050 how are timeframes important to levels
00:02:42.800 timeframes are important to levels
00:02:44.420 because they they show you the strength
00:02:46.850 of a level so for example I always use
00:02:50.690 silver for my monthly levels if I was to
00:02:52.580 just mark out some levels here right so
00:02:54.680 this would be a monthly level okay and
00:02:57.250 this up here the swing high would be a
00:03:01.010 monthly level and the bottom of this
00:03:03.290 swing high would be a monthly level just
00:03:04.970 to mark out these three levels to start
00:03:06.350 okay let's talk about that for a second
00:03:09.370 from the day of its inception on on what
00:03:13.580 am I on here by Nance from the day of
00:03:14.960 its inception when I when I first came
00:03:16.340 on by Nance
00:03:17.450 it took one two months to form this
00:03:20.090 level and three months to form these so
00:03:22.430 it took three months to form these three
00:03:23.930 levels now if we were to switch this
00:03:25.400 over to a 12 hour time frame okay
00:03:28.790 and we were to go to that same beginning
00:03:31.760 of the coins introduction into finance
00:03:35.210 we would have much more levels right so
00:03:38.300 we are going to for example just now I
00:03:40.910 don't use yellow as my 12 hour but I'm
00:03:43.040 just going to use it for this example we
00:03:44.480 are going to use yellow as it swab our
00:03:46.550 timeframe we got the swing low here
00:03:48.170 right we'd have the high of the swing
00:03:50.420 low which is right here we would have
00:03:52.250 the top of the swing high we'd have the
00:03:55.010 bottom of the swing high and so forth
00:03:57.110 and so forth as you go on throughout all
00:03:58.640 the moves right as you go on through
00:04:00.380 your chart now if we were to switch back
00:04:01.820 to the monthly those 12 hour time frames
00:04:05.600 do not have the same strength it's only
00:04:08.420 taken 12 hours to develop that level or
00:04:10.550 the series of 12 hour candles that lead
00:04:12.890 up to it maybe I don't know maybe it was
00:04:14.180 10 12 hour candles which is five days it
00:04:17.238 only took five days to make those levels
00:04:19.548 instead of possibly taking two months or
00:04:21.350 three months or six months or whatever
00:04:23.600 it is so there is a level strength that
00:04:26.210 comes with these these time frames and
00:04:30.040 that level strength is very important to
00:04:33.590 start wrapping your mind around how
00:04:36.070 these time frames that are created are
00:04:38.690 creating different levels of strength
00:04:40.310 based on how long it took to create that
00:04:43.010 level right so obviously a 15-minute
00:04:46.400 level is going to be weaker if you want
00:04:48.800 to put it in those terms weaker stronger
00:04:50.419 it's going to be weaker
00:04:52.150 for our level it's gonna be weaker than
00:04:53.560 one our level it's even gonna be weak
00:04:55.030 within a 30 minute level
00:04:56.290 now not all timeframes are relevant
00:04:58.290 however the point being is that a
00:05:01.300 15-minute is gonna be weaker than
00:05:02.710 everything above it just like an hour's
00:05:04.210 gonna be stronger than a 15-minute but
00:05:06.040 then weaker and everything above it and
00:05:07.840 so forth so it's really important to
00:05:10.030 understand that these levels that are
00:05:12.070 created with time frames they come with
00:05:15.280 a certain strength and for that reason
00:05:17.220 when we chart out any chart and we're
00:05:20.680 gonna go through this in this example in
00:05:22.600 this course part eight as you tired out
00:05:26.110 anything you always start with the
00:05:27.850 higher time frames first so anytime I'm
00:05:30.460 charting levels or anything in general I
00:05:33.520 am charting them from the month down so
00:05:36.340 I'm using monthly first right I'm using
00:05:38.230 this first then I'm using weekly levels
00:05:40.360 after that I'm only using daily levels
00:05:43.390 when I see it fit and necessary and
00:05:45.430 we'll go over that okay so why are time
00:05:51.100 frames important to trades time frames
00:05:53.350 are important to trades because they
00:05:55.240 will show you the breaking point and
00:05:56.710 they will and this is this is gonna be
00:05:59.140 the half of the course that goes into
00:06:01.570 the more advanced topics and and how and
00:06:04.870 why and when they break and the things
00:06:07.180 that we won't be discussing in this but
00:06:08.620 we are gonna touch on them right and why
00:06:12.100 are time for wire timeframes important
00:06:14.140 to trades time frames are important to
00:06:15.790 trades again because without those time
00:06:20.350 frames you cannot see the strength of a
00:06:22.210 level you are facing if you were on a
00:06:24.160 15-minute time frame you're not going to
00:06:26.620 do some kind of crazy swing trade to
00:06:30.460 break a monthly level it's not possible
00:06:32.610 it is under some circumstances but 95%
00:06:36.340 of the time it's not possible for a
00:06:37.990 15-minute time frame to all of a sudden
00:06:40.720 break a monthly level a 15-minute time
00:06:44.200 frame is gonna break an hourly level it
00:06:45.730 may test the 4-hour level right there's
00:06:47.680 a formula as to which time frame is
00:06:51.180 capable of breaking which level right
00:06:53.860 and the ratio in in and what that exists
00:06:56.950 now that's not discussed in this lesson
00:06:58.870 but it will be discussed in the future
00:07:00.430 but again the purpose of this is to
00:07:02.350 start practicing seeing time frame
00:07:05.390 because this is very valuable you need
00:07:07.400 to in your guys charting and your guys
00:07:09.680 ta and everything you do you guys need
00:07:12.380 to be avidly looking at these levels and
00:07:17.210 saying that's a monthly level that's a
00:07:19.430 weekly level that's a daily level that's
00:07:21.260 a 15-minute level and and start
00:07:23.030 observing the interactions at each level
00:07:25.310 hap with the timeframe and the strength
00:07:26.810 and keep in mind that if you're in a
00:07:28.670 15-minute level are you gonna go up and
00:07:31.400 touch a monthly level no probably not
00:07:33.350 and if you do what does that mean right
00:07:35.030 is it the first time you've touched it
00:07:36.470 in the four hour cycle if it's the first
00:07:38.750 time you've touched in a four hour cycle
00:07:40.280 which is the first time you've touched
00:07:41.870 on a daily you're not all the sudden
00:07:43.310 gonna touch it and then 30 minutes later
00:07:45.980 retrace a little bit and go right
00:07:47.210 through it because if you thought if you
00:07:48.380 think about that for a second if we were
00:07:50.600 right here right don't let's turn the
00:07:53.720 magnet to a lot huh that one always gets
00:07:56.720 me let's not talk about it let's let's
00:07:59.930 find a point yeah somewhere where
00:08:01.640 something has touched and we've only
00:08:02.930 really identified three levels right now
00:08:04.370 so it's not really important right if we
00:08:06.770 okay this is kind of just the first
00:08:08.090 thing I saw if we are looking at these
00:08:10.760 15-minute time frames right and we are
00:08:12.950 looking at this and we are right here
00:08:14.990 and let's zoom in further let's get this
00:08:17.330 nice and tight okay and we are looking
00:08:22.070 at this and we know the Silver Line is a
00:08:23.930 monthly level and we have just touched
00:08:25.700 this on a 15-minute time frame are we
00:08:29.300 all the sudden gonna lose this level and
00:08:31.190 continuously move down no let's think
00:08:33.559 about that for a second this is only
00:08:35.270 happening in a one-hour period and in
00:08:38.120 this one-hour period it's only happening
00:08:39.500 in a four-hour period so let's just
00:08:40.760 switch this to a four hour period right
00:08:42.799 what happened in whoops what happened on
00:08:46.550 that circle on that four hour period
00:08:48.140 that we did you see what happened and
00:08:50.720 that four hour period we touch down and
00:08:52.490 we held the level we are not gonna all
00:08:54.290 the Sun in a 15 minute chart just smash
00:08:56.390 down and lose a level right it's gonna
00:08:58.280 take time right patience so a 15 minute
00:09:02.060 level is not gonna go in break a monthly
00:09:04.370 level and hourly level is not gonna go
00:09:06.350 and break a month a level and you guys
00:09:07.520 need to start spotting this own right
00:09:10.160 this may look in here like this was oh
00:09:14.090 we lost a level this and that oh look at
00:09:16.280 all the sudden we have a monthly test
00:09:18.350 on an hourly level but if we were to
00:09:19.850 switch that to the daily let's see how
00:09:21.170 it looks
00:09:21.850 where's our red circle
00:09:28.340 that's why
00:09:31.120 the daily it was just a touch and I
00:09:32.800 reject to touch in a rejection and then
00:09:34.870 the next day we came down and we moved
00:09:36.189 back up because this is only a span of
00:09:37.540 three days right so a fifteen-minute
00:09:39.850 isn't going to lose a monthly level it's
00:09:43.779 gonna take multiple attempts on the
00:09:45.040 daily like this one attempt here come
00:09:47.019 down close up test again test again and
00:09:49.089 this you know if you start to look at
00:09:51.129 this trying this attempt to break this
00:09:53.319 monthly level this is happening over 1 2
00:09:56.139 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 they say I
00:09:59.769 don't know 18 days something like that
00:10:01.240 right let's swap it over the weekly
00:10:03.180 whoops
00:10:04.300 another little trading boo-boo well
00:10:08.860 actually look at it look at it on the
00:10:10.449 weekly now right we didn't even close
00:10:12.490 under this monthly level we didn't even
00:10:14.470 have a candle close under it we just
00:10:15.819 kind of tested the level right and kind
00:10:18.519 of developed this one attempt break kind
00:10:22.329 of followed by this uptrend here right
00:10:25.269 we kind of just created that so realize
00:10:28.689 that a 15-minute level is gonna have a
00:10:30.490 certain respect at a certain bounds it
00:10:32.259 lives in okay so that's why it's
00:10:34.899 important okay
00:10:38.040 one more let's get rid of that guy
00:10:44.460 so that's why it's important to
00:10:46.290 understand why time frames are important
00:10:49.260 to levels now time frames are important
00:10:51.839 to trades for a couple different reasons
00:10:53.130 and I've made a chart here that I'm
00:10:55.350 gonna scroll down and we're gonna look
00:10:56.550 at after eye chart this out but I'm
00:10:58.380 gonna walk through this I'm gonna walk
00:11:02.520 through charting this out and how I
00:11:03.930 would chart this completely to start
00:11:06.180 training your eyes so that you guys can
00:11:08.070 follow along because we've learned about
00:11:10.020 levels we've learned about trends we've
00:11:11.370 learned about valleys we've learned
00:11:12.480 about you know all those things up to
00:11:14.459 this point and if you haven't seen that
00:11:16.320 material yet videos one through seven I
00:11:19.020 would highly recommend you go through
00:11:21.060 that material and and learn it because
00:11:24.510 everything leading up to this point
00:11:25.950 you're gonna have to have a great
00:11:27.540 foundation and understanding of videos
00:11:29.580 one through seven and if you need to
00:11:30.810 watch them four or five times each do it
00:11:32.550 because most people do because they're
00:11:33.990 very context rich content rich context
00:11:39.330 rich in the content or content rich in
00:11:41.610 their context I may be both I don't know
00:11:44.010 that's the matter so to illustrate level
00:11:48.300 strength and to start training you guys
00:11:50.459 to be able to implement these level
00:11:53.130 strengths and these timeframes on your
00:11:54.810 own we are gonna go through this
00:11:55.920 step-by-step and how I charge something
00:11:59.040 from from having nothing on a chart all
00:12:01.589 the way to seeing what's going on in the
00:12:03.390 current and this is very crucial to
00:12:05.490 timeframes because you guys are gonna
00:12:07.589 understand and start to see as I'm as
00:12:09.420 I'm charting this you're you're gonna
00:12:11.220 you're gonna follow along and you're
00:12:12.510 gonna watch this and we're using Manero
00:12:14.610 in this example XMR BTC is a ticker you
00:12:18.180 guys are going to see how the timeframes
00:12:19.709 are developed and what's respected and
00:12:21.600 what's not and why these timeframes are
00:12:23.630 existing so let's start by charging this
00:12:27.270 up my monthly levels are always silver
00:12:29.459 so make sure what a magnet tool is on
00:12:32.750 take it off sometimes put it on this is
00:12:37.020 a little frustrating but we are going to
00:12:38.670 start with our first swing low always
00:12:40.770 ignoring the first candle just like I've
00:12:42.300 said in previous videos just because
00:12:43.649 there's too much volatility on the open
00:12:45.480 of a first candle it's it's not it's not
00:12:49.260 a candle I use so we have the swing low
00:12:50.790 right there's really no
00:12:57.100 swing low in this move or are sorry I
00:12:59.649 should say there's a swing home but
00:13:01.300 there's no high of the swing low in this
00:13:03.670 move because there was no downwards
00:13:05.769 movement it just moved up so this is one
00:13:07.420 of the exclusions where you don't have
00:13:10.660 the top of a level or the top of your
00:13:13.060 swing as a level right so let's start by
00:13:16.029 getting the swing low then we get the
00:13:17.980 swing high and the bottom of the swing
00:13:21.100 high right so that's our first three
00:13:23.440 levels going through this we have the
00:13:26.589 bottom of our first swing low right here
00:13:30.930 okay and then this is not going to be a
00:13:34.930 swing high because it's between two
00:13:37.329 levels it's not a new swing high right
00:13:38.920 there is a swing high here the test of
00:13:40.449 this level so this is it for the level
00:13:42.579 right here as we go down we have our
00:13:45.839 candle low and our high of that swing
00:13:50.500 low so those are our monthly levels
00:13:52.529 defined and then we would have a swing
00:13:56.740 high of this level and that's it so far
00:13:58.690 so that's your monthly levels defined
00:14:00.610 now another reason we do this is because
00:14:02.440 as we're charting if you were to track
00:14:04.360 the weekly first and then the monthly
00:14:06.069 you are gonna see a lot of overlap and
00:14:07.870 you're gonna end up deleting weekly
00:14:09.250 levels and saying okay this isn't making
00:14:10.750 sense why is this here why is out there
00:14:12.310 and then you're gonna you're gonna it's
00:14:14.170 gonna be pretty blaring the obvious that
00:14:16.779 you've entered in weekly levels first
00:14:20.230 which is wrong you want to start with
00:14:21.880 the highest timeframes okay now we go
00:14:25.180 back and we start identifying the weekly
00:14:27.579 levels okay so weekly levels for me are
00:14:30.160 always purple so let's set that before
00:14:32.050 we do anything so we have the swing low
00:14:35.290 that's already identified we have the
00:14:37.149 top of that swing low which we actually
00:14:40.000 have now here on a weekly level so we
00:14:42.189 actually did have a top of that swing
00:14:43.569 low it just wasn't on the monthly okay
00:14:45.689 so we have the bottom we have the top we
00:14:48.970 have this comes up here swing high right
00:14:51.370 we have this here is the swing low of
00:14:54.850 that high which is another level right
00:14:56.439 there you can see it okay as this moves
00:14:59.800 up this is not a level and that's
00:15:03.189 exactly what I was just explaining is
00:15:05.230 that this would be a swing low before
00:15:07.720 them you move up
00:15:08.730 but look at it if I were to put this
00:15:09.810 level here look what's happening the
00:15:12.329 level is actually a monthly right there
00:15:13.620 it's not a swing low weekly now this
00:15:17.399 would have been established prior to
00:15:19.529 this level being established so if we
00:15:20.880 were to go and do this and take this
00:15:23.639 portion out that would have never
00:15:26.130 existed so you can mark this as a swing
00:15:28.500 low but then you're just going to delete
00:15:30.180 it once the monthly comes in right once
00:15:31.769 you have
00:15:34.639 no come on step through the move
00:15:38.710 every player's being a little weird it's
00:15:40.180 going a little slow here there it is
00:15:45.100 as you did this wonder why it's doing
00:15:48.580 that being a little weird
00:15:50.350 oh because it's developing the the
00:15:52.270 weekly I see so as you did this that
00:15:55.630 would have become become the swing high
00:15:57.130 so you wouldn't need to have you you
00:16:00.700 would have deleted this at that point
00:16:01.600 you know but because we have the chart
00:16:03.970 history we can we can just delete it now
00:16:06.720 so continuing on we have the swing high
00:16:09.490 here we have the swing low here on the
00:16:12.370 weekly okay we have this comes down here
00:16:15.310 this is the swing low before the move up
00:16:18.640 so that's a weekly level right we have
00:16:21.730 the top side of this that's a weekly
00:16:24.970 level this swing high here actually test
00:16:27.850 this so that's not a swing high because
00:16:30.010 that's a monthly level this right here
00:16:35.269 would be okay so then all these levels
00:16:38.209 here these are just tests of current
00:16:39.740 levels so the swing low here ends up
00:16:41.629 being a monthly level we don't need that
00:16:43.610 and then this ends up being a level
00:16:45.679 right here on the weekly chart and the
00:16:48.800 bottom is not
00:16:54.529 as its proximity to this swing lower is
00:16:57.079 just a test of this right it's still
00:16:58.490 living within this bounce so it's okay
00:17:00.980 we can continue this swing high is not a
00:17:02.870 level as it's just testing this and
00:17:04.609 that's that's something that you guys
00:17:06.439 have to use your own discretion form
00:17:09.069 there's a certain amount of space if we
00:17:12.349 look at this here we have to expand this
00:17:15.819 twenty two thousand five hundred and
00:17:19.599 twenty sorry twenty five thousand six
00:17:21.709 hundred I don't know why I said that
00:17:22.849 said it weird tongue twister for me
00:17:25.730 twenty five thousand six hundred ten
00:17:27.380 verses twenty five thousand eight
00:17:28.669 hundred and eleven it is too close in
00:17:30.470 proximity to be a new level all that is
00:17:32.360 doing is testing this level here okay
00:17:34.610 as we come down swing low it's testing
00:17:37.100 this weekly a swing high is that monthly
00:17:40.340 the bottom of this is also not a level
00:17:43.400 as it's just testing this monthly so we
00:17:45.559 have a monthly here or monthly there
00:17:46.850 right
00:17:50.070 my cats making some noise
00:17:54.140 let's continue on right
00:17:56.630 we have swing low here top side of this
00:18:00.920 as a weekly right
00:18:05.370 second let's make sure this is correct
00:18:07.580 swing low is actually this candle right
00:18:11.370 here and this is the weekly swing low so
00:18:16.950 this is kind of an interesting one
00:18:18.000 because you have a swing low point here
00:18:19.559 on a candle that's actually got an up
00:18:21.330 move
00:18:24.050 which makes which makes it say that
00:18:26.620 although this is a this is a swing low
00:18:29.330 right here and the high of this candle
00:18:31.250 is a swing high and the high of this
00:18:33.860 candle is also a level two we will get
00:18:38.030 into that more in an advanced topic
00:18:40.580 because that is a that is an inclusion
00:18:42.800 of one of these concepts because it's on
00:18:45.350 it you have to swing lows in one move so
00:18:49.300 without getting too far into that we'll
00:18:51.500 just follow along for now
00:18:56.059 we have this swing high here this swing
00:18:58.039 low is a test of this level here it
00:18:59.840 doesn't quite test that level this is
00:19:02.749 another case where your your level is
00:19:04.369 just too close to the monthly right this
00:19:05.869 is a failed test on the monkey this is a
00:19:08.119 failed first touch on the monthly you
00:19:10.849 have your swing low level right here
00:19:18.710 and that's the weekly levels now some of
00:19:22.100 these weekly levels like this do not
00:19:25.039 exist
00:19:25.789 okay I want to identify those first and
00:19:27.770 then delete them after to show you
00:19:29.360 something this does not exist this does
00:19:31.880 not exist right now these two weekly
00:19:34.220 levels exist this does not these are
00:19:36.500 going to then be daily levels okay and
00:19:40.690 as we go into the daily levels down here
00:19:44.350 we can see that this is not a level so
00:19:47.390 this is kind of a process that you're
00:19:48.679 gonna go through and this is why you
00:19:49.789 chart out the monthly level source
00:19:51.140 because you will see that as you break
00:19:52.730 it down further you will see where it's
00:19:54.710 actually not a level it's just a test of
00:19:57.320 something else so this week we actually
00:19:58.549 wasn't a weekly level it was a test of
00:20:00.140 this monthly so this can be deleted
00:20:02.179 right that's not a level this was a test
00:20:04.460 of this monthly right you have the move
00:20:07.399 down it comes up tests it tests it again
00:20:10.220 before it breaks okay this is a level
00:20:13.399 right
00:20:15.780 this is coming up it tests it here now
00:20:18.510 let's start identifying some of these
00:20:20.250 daily levels and we are going to start
00:20:23.159 from the start of this move now the
00:20:26.159 reason we are only putting daily levels
00:20:28.980 here you will a lot of people ask me
00:20:31.470 well why aren't we doing daily levels in
00:20:33.780 in this whole entire area here and
00:20:35.730 there's a very specific reason that has
00:20:37.260 to do with timeframes okay the reason we
00:20:39.419 are not doing that hoops the reason we
00:20:41.429 are not doing that is that now before we
00:20:45.390 identify daily levels because you need
00:20:47.159 to know why we're identifying these
00:20:48.510 daily levels we are going to look for
00:20:50.850 the valley that started this let's look
00:20:52.860 at the monthly there's no valley on the
00:20:55.770 monthly let's look at the weekly
00:20:59.180 there is a valley on the weekly so this
00:21:02.000 valley is identified by the move that
00:21:04.010 started this down to that low rate there
00:21:09.890 and this close over here now there is a
00:21:14.240 weekly valley here this is very
00:21:16.190 important to know all right you can see
00:21:19.220 if we switch back to the monthly there's
00:21:20.809 no monthly Valley this is in a valley on
00:21:22.340 the monthly this is just either
00:21:24.020 accumulation of distribution right not
00:21:25.940 gonna dive too far into that if we go to
00:21:27.740 the daily right we can see that this
00:21:30.290 valley the first spot of this valley and
00:21:33.170 this has to do with timeframes right the
00:21:35.480 first spot of this valley okay it is on
00:21:38.900 the weekly you can see the valley
00:21:40.490 forming here and originally the valley
00:21:42.650 would have been like this right just
00:21:45.710 like we talked about in the last lesson
00:21:47.300 the valley would have been something
00:21:48.320 like that it broke through the valley
00:21:50.059 and it actually took a move down so then
00:21:52.010 this wedge valley wedge call it whatever
00:21:54.500 you want this wedge then gets expanded
00:21:56.360 further right because we broke down just
00:21:58.280 same same concept in principle we
00:21:59.929 learned about in the last video right so
00:22:01.790 we're just taking the bottom side of
00:22:03.590 that right we're lining it up and we are
00:22:05.990 taking this valley and we are creating
00:22:07.880 it like that so this is a weekly valley
00:22:09.760 so important to know that if my default
00:22:12.950 color usually when I do these valleys
00:22:14.420 and my videos and I've done this like
00:22:15.950 this so far for a very specific reason
00:22:17.809 I've used white that's just a neutral
00:22:20.090 color from this point on I will be using
00:22:22.340 the color code of the valley spotted out
00:22:25.580 and what that means is if my weekly
00:22:27.590 levels are purple my valley here is
00:22:29.630 going to be purple so that ties into
00:22:31.100 your timeframes concept that you need to
00:22:33.140 know right if you could only have
00:22:34.970 spotted this on the daily right if this
00:22:37.400 was only only seeable on the daily I
00:22:39.740 would be putting my valley to red
00:22:42.679 because red is my daily levels right I
00:22:44.750 would be identifying this valley as red
00:22:46.640 instead because of time frame theory I
00:22:49.040 am identifying this valley as purple
00:22:51.020 which is important because you need to
00:22:52.130 know not only the strength of levels but
00:22:54.500 the strength of valleys which are also
00:22:55.970 levels right because they are just trend
00:22:57.530 lines this is just a trend line of the
00:22:59.210 hard left edge right here and we're
00:23:01.100 gonna line this up perfectly on the
00:23:02.510 daily and then swap it back to the
00:23:04.280 weekly right
00:23:06.550 and you can see here Manero is is
00:23:09.280 respecting this hard hard edge trendline
00:23:11.320 this valley that it's created it's
00:23:12.880 respecting but its first viewable on the
00:23:15.520 weekly right you can identify a valley
00:23:17.800 on the weekly which is very important
00:23:19.390 okay you can't identify this on a
00:23:23.530 monthly you can't it's not enough time
00:23:25.660 for you can identify a monthly Valley
00:23:27.340 here on on this right you can identify
00:23:31.000 this silver Valley if I was going to
00:23:33.520 color it you could identify this valley
00:23:35.500 here because it's had enough time to
00:23:36.700 build this valley right you would be
00:23:38.890 able to then go whoops you'd be able to
00:23:42.670 then go like this and and change this
00:23:45.280 one to silver and that would be a
00:23:47.020 monthly Valley but that's not what we're
00:23:49.840 talking about this video and we're not
00:23:50.800 there we're looking at this move right
00:23:52.480 here at this weekly Valley okay so
00:23:56.550 important to know that as we look at
00:24:00.400 these timeframes right we are only
00:24:02.440 starting the daily from this valley we
00:24:05.230 don't we don't need to chart out daily
00:24:07.600 levels up in here we don't we don't need
00:24:09.280 to know anything that's outside of this
00:24:11.230 valley right whoops let's delete that we
00:24:15.970 don't need to chart any of the daily
00:24:17.500 levels again it's being funny
00:24:19.660 huh we don't need to chart any of the
00:24:21.400 daily levels in here we need to chart
00:24:23.320 the daily levels that are in the valley
00:24:24.460 to see what's happening in the current
00:24:25.750 move we are testing to break out of this
00:24:28.810 valley so this time frame we are going
00:24:31.030 to take the weeks that it takes to test
00:24:32.590 outside of this valley and hopefully
00:24:34.210 we're gonna ride this trend line of this
00:24:36.580 valley all the way up right but it's it
00:24:38.860 this is not a 15-minute chart so it's
00:24:40.600 not gonna happen in 15 minutes we're not
00:24:42.160 gonna do something like this right we're
00:24:44.590 not gonna do something like that
00:24:45.580 straight up it's not it's not realistic
00:24:46.930 this is a valley that's been created
00:24:48.100 over how many weeks let's count because
00:24:50.290 this all this all factors in in in the
00:24:54.940 strength of levels and valleys and trend
00:24:56.680 lines are levels to remember that so
00:24:58.390 let's look at this now we have 1 2 3 4 5
00:25:02.110 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 we
00:25:07.990 have been in this valley for 19 weeks
00:25:09.540 when you're not gonna break it in an
00:25:11.380 hour we're not gonna break it in two
00:25:12.490 hours we're gonna make moves over days
00:25:15.820 and this is where this concept gets
00:25:17.800 important we are going to make moves
00:25:19.779 over days then this day we're gonna
00:25:21.159 conquer fail this level that day we're
00:25:23.049 gonna conquer fail that level right so
00:25:25.029 you guys need to start spotting this out
00:25:26.559 and that's why we are only using daily
00:25:29.349 levels right now so let's start to
00:25:30.909 identify daily levels within this wedge
00:25:36.250 okay so we're gonna start here monthly
00:25:40.820 level we're gonna start here we go down
00:25:46.760 we touch the monthly level we come up
00:25:48.880 this is a daily level
00:25:52.810 right that's a daily level let's put the
00:25:55.270 magnet tool back on top side of that
00:25:59.060 bottom side of that that's a daily level
00:26:01.700 we can see we immediately broke out and
00:26:04.040 we came and tested that level again
00:26:06.140 let's keep keep going
00:26:10.840 is it here right there
00:26:15.070 the note we're not done yet that we
00:26:17.590 haven't seen a swing oh yeah we have we
00:26:18.880 have right there swing low right here
00:26:19.960 top side of this is a level the bottom
00:26:22.390 side is not and the reason the bottom
00:26:24.160 side is not a level is because it's
00:26:26.260 testing this weekly right this is not a
00:26:28.720 level because it's testing the weekly so
00:26:30.040 it's important to know that within these
00:26:31.390 moves this this is not a level because
00:26:34.360 it's testing the weekly right at the
00:26:36.970 bottom side of this and we've got the
00:26:41.670 upside of that candle there as we go
00:26:46.120 down this is a test of the weekly or
00:26:48.760 this actually might be the creation of
00:26:50.230 or sorry not the weekly the month it
00:26:52.120 this might be the creation of the
00:26:53.020 monthly regardless of if this is a
00:26:54.880 creation or not we know that's a level
00:26:57.010 and we've seen the daily test right
00:26:58.420 there so those aren't levels okay swing
00:27:02.110 down is not done so this is a daily
00:27:04.000 level down here
00:27:07.160 and the top of this is a daily level as
00:27:09.290 well
00:27:11.170 okay let's continue moving on through
00:27:12.640 this move swing hi right there that's a
00:27:16.840 level
00:27:19.549 touches a monthly level from from
00:27:21.110 previous so we can keep going the swing
00:27:24.049 high of this is a test of this daily so
00:27:27.769 it's important to start looking at this
00:27:30.169 and seeing where the tests are and and
00:27:32.600 where they aren't right this right here
00:27:34.220 the test of this so it's not it's not a
00:27:35.869 new daily level and this swing low is
00:27:38.929 not a level either okay this is the
00:27:42.590 level right here this swing low on the
00:27:44.090 move that is the level right there and
00:27:45.799 the top of this swing low is a test of
00:27:47.600 that previous level okay we come up we
00:27:49.759 see that this is the test of a level
00:27:51.139 right there
00:27:53.400 so we come up we go over that level this
00:27:57.120 is not a level either right you don't
00:27:58.800 have a third level here you have a test
00:28:00.660 of this level right here this is not a
00:28:03.180 new level despite what this candle looks
00:28:04.770 like it's not a new level this was a
00:28:06.660 test of this level right and then we
00:28:08.640 have the monthly form there okay
00:28:10.650 swing low down here this is swing low as
00:28:14.580 a level but the top is not because the
00:28:16.320 top is a test of the monthly okay as we
00:28:18.960 go down tests test tests
00:28:24.210 this is not a level is it sometimes it
00:28:28.830 gets hard to see I don't think that's a
00:28:30.990 level no that's not a level the swing
00:28:33.659 low was rate here that's right it's not
00:28:34.799 a level because the swing lows here and
00:28:36.179 the top side of this is the just the
00:28:38.190 test of the weekly level right we go up
00:28:40.580 that's not a level because it's touching
00:28:44.970 that daily bottom side of this would be
00:28:49.529 a level right top side is just a test of
00:28:52.830 that and it looks like that is it this
00:28:56.279 is a fail touch of that
00:28:59.530 so now you can see as we step through
00:29:03.610 this move right now let's break it down
00:29:06.220 into for our chart we can see what's
00:29:08.380 happening so now you can start to
00:29:11.500 understand why the daily level is so
00:29:14.290 important why the weekly and the monthly
00:29:15.820 level is so important why time frame you
00:29:17.860 you chart down because you can now see
00:29:20.250 what's going to happen in the
00:29:22.180 intermediate of this coin and not you
00:29:23.680 now have an understanding of your
00:29:24.730 charters here's what the monthly levels
00:29:26.380 are there's where the weekly levels are
00:29:28.690 there's what the daily levels are and
00:29:30.850 here's where the target lies so let's
00:29:32.110 just kind of step through this move a
00:29:33.250 little bit at a time okay
00:29:35.920 and we're just gonna start from here we
00:29:37.450 just pick an arbitrary spot it does it
00:29:38.890 doesn't really we'll start from here
00:29:40.000 okay so we got a weekly level here right
00:29:42.340 oops naw magnet again thing always gets
00:29:46.630 me okay we're just gonna start right
00:29:50.680 here just because it's what's on our
00:29:51.730 screen okay we have a test down of the
00:29:53.170 weekly level obviously weekly levels
00:29:54.700 been established right here right so
00:29:57.370 then we have a test up of this daily
00:29:58.900 level we reject and come back down and
00:30:00.730 establish first tot the first touch of
00:30:03.280 this weekly level 90% of time first
00:30:06.430 touch is going to reject as we've talked
00:30:07.840 about we can now see as this coin is
00:30:09.910 moving up every four hours now remember
00:30:12.010 this is a four-hour chart so there might
00:30:13.540 it might look like there's a lot of
00:30:14.650 levels on here but this is gonna
00:30:16.120 describe exactly what this move is doing
00:30:18.040 right and and how time frames are going
00:30:21.700 to show you the importance of these
00:30:24.250 moves right so now we come up back over
00:30:27.370 this monthly level because we never
00:30:28.420 really lost the month in level we kind
00:30:29.920 of just got weekly level established and
00:30:32.890 then we move back up over the monthly
00:30:34.300 level we never actually lost this
00:30:35.470 monthly level we would have have to go
00:30:36.640 way down to lose it so then we come up
00:30:39.040 and we establish a daily swing high here
00:30:41.800 we know red is our daily come down take
00:30:44.700 first touch which is always gonna be
00:30:47.050 rejection 90% of the time there's a
00:30:48.910 small window in there where it can go
00:30:51.700 through based on other criteria but we
00:30:53.560 know 90% of the time first touch is
00:30:55.030 gonna reject we come down right 90% of
00:30:58.240 the time first touch is also going to
00:31:00.040 reject remember we came up over this
00:31:01.690 move here right first touch up first
00:31:05.320 touchdown or
00:31:07.370 test break right now we've touched and
00:31:11.390 tested this month they love on the past
00:31:12.650 we're not gonna go further back in this
00:31:15.140 chart right we would have actually had
00:31:16.280 to break this monthly level to gain this
00:31:18.590 as a level which is very important we
00:31:21.260 would have had to wick over that to gain
00:31:23.270 this remember we talked about that in
00:31:24.950 the levels video we would have actually
00:31:27.050 had to wick the monthly level to gain
00:31:29.300 that so we never actually wick tit so we
00:31:31.670 never actually gained it important to
00:31:33.620 know for the future now I don't know
00:31:34.820 what this is gonna look like in the
00:31:35.870 future like I said I do all this stuff
00:31:37.160 on the fly so that's why sometimes I'm
00:31:39.350 charting like this and you guys see and
00:31:40.940 you're like oh is he look confused
00:31:42.260 because I'm figuring that out as I go
00:31:43.520 and I'm charting it as I go because I
00:31:45.110 don't preach art this stuff I just do it
00:31:46.970 on the fly so then we can see monthly
00:31:50.150 level goes up and over
00:31:51.080 it comes down touches the daily comes up
00:31:54.050 here tests a daily level from the past
00:31:56.290 wherever that is okay so that was
00:31:58.280 identified way back here somewhere
00:32:00.559 right there it was identified right we
00:32:04.040 come up and we push past that level here
00:32:08.320 don't quite get to our weekly target and
00:32:10.970 come down create a new monthly level
00:32:13.120 bounce off or a new daily level sorry
00:32:16.070 bounce off that daily level come up
00:32:18.170 break the weekly now let's think about
00:32:20.330 this for a second if we are breaking
00:32:21.950 this weekly okay it means that we just
00:32:25.280 gained this weekly down here so this is
00:32:29.150 now gained support this was actually
00:32:31.970 never lost so we actually didn't gain it
00:32:34.340 it was just was never lost it was
00:32:36.410 established and never lost when we would
00:32:38.480 pass this level it's going to give us
00:32:40.490 the momentum to test the monthly level
00:32:43.610 right it's not gonna give the momentum
00:32:45.590 breaking a weekly levels not going to
00:32:47.090 give the momentum to test a daily level
00:32:48.770 and that's why you notice in this four
00:32:51.440 hour span right here when we wick past
00:32:53.630 this weekly level and we've got a weekly
00:32:55.640 level down here when we wake past this
00:32:57.890 we actually test two daily levels right
00:33:00.740 within that four hour window right so
00:33:02.480 that's a perfect example of why
00:33:04.610 timeframes are so important because you
00:33:06.590 have if you did this to it if this was a
00:33:08.990 daily level if this Purple Line was a
00:33:10.400 daily level you probably would have just
00:33:11.960 stopped short right there
00:33:12.950 right you one have wycked two daily
00:33:15.710 levels in the same four-hour window that
00:33:17.840 could have been a 15-minute window that
00:33:19.130 that happened I'm not sure I haven't
00:33:20.240 broken the
00:33:20.750 move down but this could have been 15
00:33:22.160 minutes possibly what we know right now
00:33:23.980 based on what we're looking at is it's
00:33:25.970 in one for our chart we not only wick
00:33:28.580 the weekly level but that gave us a
00:33:29.930 momentum to wick to daily levels at that
00:33:33.110 point breaking this weekly level so time
00:33:35.480 frame theory that's an important level
00:33:37.700 to break what will we do next we will
00:33:39.230 test a monthly level and we establish a
00:33:41.570 monthly level right there right so I
00:33:43.580 think that's where we establish the
00:33:45.200 monthly level so we break two to daily
00:33:47.570 levels we establish a monthly level we
00:33:49.520 come back down we test let's verify that
00:33:56.669 pretty sure that established the level
00:33:58.230 yeah so that established the ending of
00:34:00.779 that move right there so in that time
00:34:02.759 period that was let's go back and take a
00:34:06.389 look this was the final four eight
00:34:12.960 twelve this was the final twelve hours
00:34:15.030 before the month so now that's another
00:34:17.219 important thing to realize there too is
00:34:18.929 this was at the end of a month so no it
00:34:23.309 wasn't at the end of the month it was at
00:34:24.418 the beginning of the month okay so this
00:34:25.589 in this case this was at the beginning
00:34:26.790 of the month and at the beginning of the
00:34:28.109 month this for eight twelve that
00:34:30.030 established the full month's monthly
00:34:31.770 high so that's another important piece
00:34:33.929 to know is that this is establishing the
00:34:36.000 monthly high rate at the beginning of
00:34:37.918 the month and you'll see that a lot of
00:34:39.389 the times at the end of the month and
00:34:40.710 the beginning of the month which also
00:34:42.559 comes into time frame theory as well
00:34:45.000 because you're gonna see large moves at
00:34:47.309 the end of a day at the end of a week
00:34:51.119 cycle at the end of a month cycle so and
00:34:54.199 opposite to the beginning because it's
00:34:56.429 setting a tone for the the current month
00:34:58.319 or the next month so that's also another
00:35:00.210 important thing to know when you guys
00:35:01.589 are charting and looking at these things
00:35:03.150 take note to which day it is it has more
00:35:05.670 significance if these moves are
00:35:07.440 happening at the end of the month so if
00:35:09.480 this is happening on the 27th and you're
00:35:11.460 seeing a move form this has more
00:35:12.720 significance than if it happens on the
00:35:14.160 15th just because that's ending a
00:35:17.130 monthly chart so that move is going to
00:35:19.290 tell you more more about that in a
00:35:22.049 future it might you know my famous
00:35:23.190 saying more about that in a future video
00:35:24.990 but I wanted to open your minds right
00:35:26.849 now to the concept of what day of the
00:35:29.609 week it is if this is happening on a
00:35:31.740 Sunday afternoon and that's the end of a
00:35:33.240 week chart start looking for that and
00:35:35.880 spotting it out is this happening at the
00:35:37.799 end of a day is this happen is a one
00:35:39.420 hour candles doing something at the end
00:35:41.400 of the day is a daily candle doing
00:35:44.280 something at the end of a week is a
00:35:45.390 weekly candle doing something at the end
00:35:46.890 of a month or at the beginning of these
00:35:48.720 timeframes as well so just keep that in
00:35:51.089 mind as we go through this course that I
00:35:53.460 want you guys to start looking at the
00:35:55.170 days in which these moves happen okay so
00:35:59.190 moving on through this move we go down
00:36:01.530 we test this daily level come down here
00:36:05.160 we then break this weekly level right we
00:36:08.670 then come back we
00:36:09.690 back down from this weekly level which
00:36:11.580 means what if we're losing a weekly
00:36:13.350 level timeframe theory dictates that our
00:36:16.050 next target right if we were gonna get
00:36:17.700 reentry should be at a monthly level
00:36:19.230 right because we're losing a weekly the
00:36:22.740 strength relativity to that is not that
00:36:25.140 we broke a weekly a daily is gonna
00:36:27.930 offset us completely it might take up to
00:36:29.760 a monthly get a monthly level to offset
00:36:33.030 us okay and we all remember we are all
00:36:34.800 still within this weekly wedge that's
00:36:36.510 happening so as we go we touch down to
00:36:39.840 the daily level we come up we try to
00:36:41.460 regain that we get rejection off the
00:36:43.770 daily I'm down and ultimately after this
00:36:46.740 dance what do we do after we lose this
00:36:48.420 level we end up testing the monthly just
00:36:53.280 as I said we would right we end up
00:36:55.560 losing the weekly level right or wicking
00:36:58.290 past that I should say breaking it we
00:36:59.670 don't lose it until we actually wick
00:37:01.170 this we don't lose that until we wick
00:37:03.720 that weekly but we lose this level here
00:37:08.610 right we break the level we don't we
00:37:11.970 don't lose it we break it which is you
00:37:13.560 know closing out of it
00:37:14.580 so then what what happens we touch our
00:37:17.310 monthly level which is the same thing
00:37:18.870 that happened over here
00:37:20.010 we break a weekly level we establish a
00:37:22.440 monthly level we break the weekly level
00:37:26.460 here we touch the monthly level so
00:37:27.900 timeframe relativity and strength right
00:37:30.120 so understanding what these timeframes
00:37:31.470 mean and and the the relative strength
00:37:34.560 of these moves okay so we come up we
00:37:37.710 touch the weekly we kind of go through
00:37:38.910 this dance right go back and forth and
00:37:41.400 we're just kind of kind of speed this up
00:37:42.750 because we're dragging this out a bit
00:37:44.040 you know maybe to where we are now and
00:37:47.010 we you know we we bounce between levels
00:37:49.110 and do all this stuff here and you guys
00:37:51.990 can see that the levels are being
00:37:53.760 respected all the way through you know
00:37:55.080 you've got two levels here that it's
00:37:56.370 kind of struggling to stay in between
00:37:57.720 you've got you know this just channel
00:37:59.880 that it stays in here until it loses you
00:38:02.280 know it loses this and then it goes into
00:38:03.660 its next channel which is here and then
00:38:06.270 we have kind of the identifying closing
00:38:08.220 of this wedge right this weekly wedge so
00:38:11.240 let's look at this when we are in this
00:38:16.140 right here we are now starting to test
00:38:20.740 the time theory on this wedge right
00:38:23.230 remember we have a weekly wedge chair so
00:38:25.690 let's scroll into this we have a weekly
00:38:27.310 wedge here we now are going to do one of
00:38:30.310 two things we are going to continue
00:38:32.880 oops oh we don't want the arrow that's
00:38:36.670 not what I wanted at all we are going to
00:38:38.950 continue testing this wedge as support
00:38:44.859 right we're gonna continuously bounce
00:38:46.810 off and come up until we can either you
00:38:48.670 know close out of this wedge or we're
00:38:50.830 going to move sideways and and move down
00:38:52.839 right either one you have to realize
00:38:56.619 that this is not going to happen in 15
00:38:57.880 minutes and and what's gonna happen next
00:38:59.530 we're not going to dissect that but what
00:39:01.030 we are going to talk about is is this
00:39:03.640 right time frame relativity take a look
00:39:06.099 at this we are not going to take a rapid
00:39:10.150 move down off this wedge that's being
00:39:13.599 created that's been created over the
00:39:15.670 course of whatever was we said 18 weeks
00:39:17.920 or whatever we are not going to break
00:39:19.960 this in one 15 minute move it's gonna
00:39:21.580 take multiple attempts multiple breaks
00:39:24.820 and this is on a 15 minute chart and
00:39:26.589 what does that mean for the 4-hour chart
00:39:27.760 you know what is this for knee tests in
00:39:30.369 there what is that on a 4-hour chart
00:39:31.450 like how many tests right
00:39:37.370 hounds all these moves is tests right or
00:39:39.080 start from here on one two three four
00:39:40.760 five six seven eight nine ten eleven
00:39:43.490 twelve thirteen fourteen fourteen tests
00:39:45.860 and it's not breaking let's go to the
00:39:47.210 daily right you can call all these tests
00:39:50.840 because this is the trendline I just
00:39:52.100 have a drawn improperly
00:39:53.090 one two three four five six seven seven
00:39:55.970 daily tests right well what is that on a
00:39:57.740 weekly this is a weekly wet remember
00:40:00.140 that how many weeks have we tested this
00:40:02.240 right we came here we tested it once
00:40:05.600 we've tested it twice now let's use time
00:40:09.950 frame relativity with level with some of
00:40:12.890 the stuff we learned about levels right
00:40:14.180 this right here
00:40:18.030 touch we know that's rejecting this move
00:40:20.370 up was bound to happen right that's
00:40:24.120 first touch right there 90% of time
00:40:25.920 that's rejecting this is first test off
00:40:29.010 this valley or this wedge and actually
00:40:31.260 let's do something else here
00:40:34.589 let's
00:40:38.350 that so
00:40:41.800 guys to see here I drew a trendline
00:40:43.630 there even though we're in a valley
00:40:44.830 we're in a valley on the daily right we
00:40:46.600 can clearly see that this valley is
00:40:48.910 being pulled up like that but on a
00:40:50.470 weekly we have this other trend that's
00:40:52.330 going on now on this trend right here
00:40:55.090 this is establishment of the trend those
00:40:58.630 tools being funny let's let's try to
00:41:01.240 circle it a little larger it's trading
00:41:03.340 these tools they're a little know-it-all
00:41:05.920 funny sometimes okay we have the first
00:41:09.300 swing right here we have the
00:41:11.950 establishment of that trend line we have
00:41:14.620 first
00:41:15.490 touch right here this is first touch on
00:41:18.220 the weekly chart when this comes down
00:41:20.590 next and test this right if this comes
00:41:22.720 down and test it I would expect it to
00:41:24.430 break on the next touch if it touches
00:41:26.760 again on this chart okay because this
00:41:30.640 was established as the swing low
00:41:33.280 beginning of trend first touch next is
00:41:37.270 going to be first test so if on the
00:41:39.850 weekly we break out of this I fully
00:41:41.890 expect momentum to come and touch this
00:41:43.930 level here to potentially break it
00:41:46.450 because we are getting rejection out of
00:41:50.740 this wedge we are gonna move sideways
00:41:52.090 straight out of this wedge and then I
00:41:53.500 would fully expect it to break this as
00:41:55.240 we've already established first test
00:41:57.160 right here right we've already
00:41:58.390 established or sorry first touch we are
00:42:00.490 now going into first test which means it
00:42:02.260 has the potential to break off this
00:42:04.270 first touch here on the weekly we should
00:42:06.580 expect a pretty wild move up it's not a
00:42:08.350 15-minute first touch it's not an hourly
00:42:10.210 first touch this is a weekly first touch
00:42:12.940 off a weekly trend so that's very
00:42:15.310 important to know that this was expected
00:42:18.610 to be a rampant move up right and look
00:42:21.970 how violent that move was right because
00:42:24.340 it's time frame relativity because the
00:42:26.440 time frame is dictating the strength of
00:42:28.480 the move it's dictating the strength of
00:42:30.460 the rejection of the offset it dictates
00:42:32.470 everything that we have learned in the
00:42:34.600 past that dictates levels it dictates
00:42:36.820 movement if they take it dictates volume
00:42:38.980 if this is happening on a 15-minute
00:42:40.180 chart there's only so much that can that
00:42:42.730 then the move can happen on the 15
00:42:44.410 minutes right let's go look at where I
00:42:45.460 start well down the 15 minute all holy
00:42:47.830 crap those are huge zones
00:42:52.660 right so this was the beginning of that
00:42:54.339 wild move up and look at how many
00:42:56.410 candles the guy I don't know how that's
00:42:57.760 a long time this is October 28th all the
00:43:02.740 way to where it's swung up November 4th
00:43:05.920 so this is this is a pretty you know
00:43:07.930 that's a week so this is a week of
00:43:09.849 15-minute candles right so time frame
00:43:12.190 relativity right don't expect you to
00:43:19.050 that's still there this is starting to
00:43:20.580 look pretty pretty bad here let's delete
00:43:22.080 some of this I'm pretty you know when it
00:43:24.420 comes to my my charts and how clean they
00:43:26.310 look don't expect first touch right
00:43:31.500 don't expect this right here to be a
00:43:33.300 wild move up on a 15-minute chart so
00:43:35.010 have have that in your mind that you
00:43:38.160 need to start seeing levels versus time
00:43:42.060 right the strength of time and what that
00:43:45.150 means when you're in the moment okay and
00:43:46.980 we're gonna leave it at that because I
00:43:48.120 can I can go on with this for quite some
00:43:50.190 time and this is already a pretty long
00:43:51.480 recording and this is why we couldn't
00:43:53.870 discuss and we have one more pretty cool
00:43:55.950 thing to go over this is why we couldn't
00:43:57.270 discuss all of time frame in one video
00:43:59.160 because the amount of information that
00:44:01.140 there is a time frames I could be
00:44:04.290 talking about this for two to three
00:44:05.100 hours so we're gonna leave it at that
00:44:07.230 and you guys can see as this move goes
00:44:09.660 out and as we followed this move the the
00:44:13.530 relativity to strength of levels and
00:44:16.650 when why time frames are important okay
00:44:19.320 now the last thing this is a really
00:44:22.350 important piece now this is pretty cool
00:44:24.060 this is a chart I created and not all to
00:44:27.210 my credit I've taken small pieces off
00:44:29.310 other charts and I've created half of it
00:44:31.200 and I've used my own ratios in my own
00:44:32.880 formula but this is this is kind of a
00:44:34.500 common chart like this I wonder if I can
00:44:37.110 have a highlighter tool I can't so I'm
00:44:39.660 just gonna say this
00:44:40.410 entry on so this column here and this
00:44:43.440 chart levels and this hour period this
00:44:46.530 is like common knowledge but I have my
00:44:48.840 own formula that I use just things that
00:44:52.680 I've tweaked that make more sense than
00:44:54.480 kind of the generic stuff that's on
00:44:55.890 there and you know I have hours on mine
00:44:58.320 so mine's a little more elaborate than
00:44:59.760 what you find online about these charts
00:45:01.740 and what they look like but this is my
00:45:05.040 formula and what I found to be pretty
00:45:08.250 bang on my ratios my hours in each day
00:45:12.390 and the trades and all those things so
00:45:13.650 the information this is this the inputs
00:45:16.200 I guess you would call it the inputs are
00:45:17.760 my own inputs but this chart is a common
00:45:19.920 used template because it's the best way
00:45:23.370 to put it put it so okay time frames now
00:45:29.430 this kind of
00:45:31.260 important to with timeframes and I want
00:45:33.869 you guys to follow where my mouse is so
00:45:35.850 we're gonna type talked about the type
00:45:37.080 of trader and this is where we're gonna
00:45:38.730 start and the way you use this chart and
00:45:41.130 you guys feel free to use this you know
00:45:43.560 screen shot at whatever coffee it you
00:45:45.359 don't use it I took the time to make it
00:45:48.300 and build it out way back when get some
00:45:51.390 use out of it so this is going to be
00:45:53.730 what type of trader you are you are I
00:45:55.050 they're going to be a scalper a day
00:45:56.580 trader a swing trader or a position
00:45:58.050 trader or you could be all the above I
00:46:00.150 am all for I have positions in every
00:46:02.609 category
00:46:03.359 I don't limit myself to just one or two
00:46:05.640 or three or four to me I like to be a
00:46:07.109 well-rounded trader and all so if you
00:46:10.350 are doing scalp trades and you are
00:46:12.570 entering based on 15 minute candles so
00:46:14.670 entry on is based on what you're
00:46:16.740 entering and you're using chart levels
00:46:20.070 right so the chart levels this is an
00:46:22.440 hourly ratio
00:46:23.640 four to one so if you're entering in a
00:46:25.560 15-minute chart which means we're gonna
00:46:29.340 go back to this if you are looking at a
00:46:30.660 15-minute entry if you are watching
00:46:32.250 charts on the 15-minute and looking
00:46:34.640 let's just pick some I don't know some
00:46:37.650 arbitrary spot let's let's just go with
00:46:39.240 right here if you are looking at this
00:46:40.800 chart right and we're just gonna pick
00:46:42.359 right here this is the move up okay and
00:46:44.100 we were just gonna pick yellow for
00:46:46.740 15-minute move if you are moving up
00:46:48.300 right and you saw okay this is the top
00:46:50.190 of that swing high and this is the
00:46:51.450 bottom at the top we already know was a
00:46:53.580 daily level so let's just use the bottom
00:46:55.290 is gonna be probably the most relevant
00:46:57.990 entry because we know the daily level is
00:47:00.119 there so we don't need to mark that out
00:47:02.220 if you are using a 15-minute chart
00:47:04.740 you are gonna swap over to the hourly
00:47:06.840 you are gonna map out your 15 right and
00:47:09.810 you are going whoops I don't want to
00:47:12.450 move the wedge I just want to find where
00:47:13.650 I put my yellow line you are gonna move
00:47:15.330 to the hourly and the first touch on
00:47:16.950 that hourly is where you are going to
00:47:18.780 take your position okay so that's how
00:47:21.090 you use this chart that makes sense I
00:47:24.480 hope it does it's very brief but I'm on
00:47:26.369 a 15-minute are and I'm looking at this
00:47:27.900 move and I see a top salt right here
00:47:29.369 okay I see it tops all right here and
00:47:32.550 this is the zone that it's fighting for
00:47:35.190 in that 15-minute chart and I've
00:47:36.990 identified that if this move was right
00:47:39.840 here right I've identified that at this
00:47:41.940 point
00:47:43.470 I've identified that this is a move up
00:47:44.940 and that's the level before we're gonna
00:47:48.390 see what it does next weather continues
00:47:50.070 to go up or down and this is the bottom
00:47:51.540 of that swing low on the top is a daily
00:47:53.010 level I am going to then switch over to
00:47:55.710 my hourly chart and I am going to make
00:47:57.869 my decision based on what's happening on
00:47:59.640 the hourly
00:48:02.300 where are we here
00:48:04.930 wait a second did tradingview just make
00:48:06.759 an error it did what the heck oh I have
00:48:11.019 to I have to cut it back when you when
00:48:13.599 you swap over here loses where you cut
00:48:15.279 the where you cut your chart so it would
00:48:17.980 have been right here that's odd
00:48:23.470 right here the chart got cut okay so
00:48:26.140 I've now identified that this is target
00:48:28.810 and this is where it's fighting for so
00:48:30.400 whatever happens on the hourly chart is
00:48:32.619 where you're taking your position oh
00:48:34.109 I'll shoot you no no no wrong by then so
00:48:38.980 if you are trading on the roofie chart
00:48:42.880 right
00:48:45.410 we got that there beat up another hour
00:48:48.170 that is where you would have taken
00:48:49.579 position based on the type of trader you
00:48:51.710 are so let's go back and look at this
00:48:53.089 for a second we mark out the 15-minute
00:48:55.549 chart we take position based on hourly
00:48:58.460 touches and we are holding for six hours
00:49:00.259 maximum that is what we are doing that
00:49:02.869 is called a scalper okay so let's see
00:49:04.549 how this plays out over six hours now
00:49:05.900 this isn't saying our six take exit you
00:49:09.829 have to identify your own exit targets
00:49:11.539 and and your stop losses and all those
00:49:13.160 things but to define this as an out as a
00:49:15.769 scalp trade if you are entering based on
00:49:18.739 15-minute charts you don't want to be in
00:49:20.900 this for more than six hours now there
00:49:22.759 there is exclusions a move can be still
00:49:25.039 up but if your scalp trading proper
00:49:27.079 identification says that you are not
00:49:28.819 holding this more than six hours right
00:49:31.369 so let's see so this is one two three
00:49:35.180 you might have taken exit here right
00:49:37.489 probably not you probably would have at
00:49:38.900 least like to see the test of the level
00:49:40.819 or the bottom touch of the sums the for
00:49:42.829 the first touch of evey of these levels
00:49:44.089 you probably would have taken exit four
00:49:45.549 five so that's actually where you would
00:49:47.630 have taken exit would would have been up
00:49:49.130 here at some level five six okay so at
00:49:53.329 the sixth hour maximum timeframe says
00:49:55.309 that you should one two three four five
00:49:57.349 six that that's where you should have
00:49:58.430 exited if your scalp trading went down
00:50:01.910 after that retested that level so on the
00:50:04.009 sixth hour actually perfect trade AHA
00:50:07.749 one two three four five six you would
00:50:10.369 have exited here on the second test of
00:50:12.170 this level and then you actually
00:50:13.700 probably would have rebar and then
00:50:15.170 another six hours stretch one two three
00:50:19.400 four five okay so maybe you would have
00:50:22.819 six okay and then so you would have
00:50:24.829 actually exited on the exact same level
00:50:26.299 so that's pretty cool I'm actually kind
00:50:29.569 of I'm kind of happy it happened like
00:50:31.400 that I just picked this random spot but
00:50:33.920 you can see like the scalp trading
00:50:36.339 I'm just curious we're gonna do six more
00:50:38.839 hours I don't know what the heck is
00:50:40.009 gonna happen here but it is very cool
00:50:41.920 one don't tell me it's gonna go down two
00:50:45.469 three four five don't do it six okay so
00:50:50.900 it wasn't like a hundred percent that I
00:50:53.989 actually tried to test this level and
00:50:55.369 got rejected but on that kind of that's
00:50:56.779 I use a six to one ratio
00:50:58.850 I found through the years of using the
00:51:01.130 six to one ratio that's how scalps work
00:51:02.690 best and this is kind of the way it
00:51:03.920 looks like usually on scalps as you go
00:51:05.810 through these six-hour windows and
00:51:08.050 you're kind of best results are limited
00:51:10.670 to a three to six hour window a lot of
00:51:12.620 people do only four hours but you know I
00:51:14.420 like to extend it to six because there's
00:51:15.890 been a lot of times I have when I
00:51:17.300 haven't quite done six hours and yeah
00:51:22.180 and then after the first six-hour
00:51:24.220 stretch that was actually kind of your
00:51:25.570 high point you you actually could have
00:51:26.950 got better entry but one two three
00:51:29.290 I'm just keeping and keeping on going to
00:51:30.550 this four five six so that would have
00:51:33.910 been entry there one two three probably
00:51:39.430 would I exited there or five six yeah I
00:51:44.740 would exit it on a level there I'm not
00:51:46.810 I'm not gonna keep going I've proved my
00:51:48.880 point of as to why I use a six six to
00:51:50.620 one ratio that's just kind of cool it
00:51:52.390 worked out that way and then how many
00:51:54.730 hours a day does that take that takes
00:51:56.530 four to six hours daily to do that so
00:51:58.660 the hours you're gonna spend if you are
00:52:00.010 a scalper you are spending four to 16
00:52:02.650 hours every day in front of your trading
00:52:04.720 screen and there's nothing wrong with
00:52:05.710 that that was insane profits there I
00:52:07.600 don't know how much that was I mean geez
00:52:09.760 let's take a look at that for a second
00:52:11.200 how much how much were the profits in
00:52:12.790 this thing from from here to here and
00:52:14.860 how many times did we do it Oh magnet
00:52:17.230 tool please one of these days I mean
00:52:20.800 you're gonna fight so this would have
00:52:23.950 been for a scalper 2.5% each time and we
00:52:28.510 had one two three so you would have
00:52:33.340 gotten seven and a half P would have
00:52:34.480 gotten seven and a half percent on on on
00:52:36.280 using that ratio by identifying levels
00:52:38.620 correctly so using that ratio of six
00:52:41.380 hours identifying levels correctly you
00:52:43.360 can see time frame is also science just
00:52:46.000 like everything else time frame is a
00:52:47.230 science so like I said feel free to copy
00:52:49.930 my chart and do as you please and as a
00:52:53.440 scalp trader you are gonna spend an
00:52:54.940 absorbent amount of time daily charting
00:52:57.670 so if you want to be a scalp trader be
00:52:59.410 prepared to spend four to 16 hours every
00:53:01.780 single day in front of your computer
00:53:03.430 right if you are just the scalp trader
00:53:05.770 now I'm gonna get into my formula in a
00:53:07.540 few minutes here after I go through
00:53:08.860 those as a day trader you're spending
00:53:10.870 two to six hours daily you're looking
00:53:13.300 for entry on hourly just like we did
00:53:14.950 with a 15-minute you're just adjusting
00:53:16.330 it to the hourly and you're looking at
00:53:18.400 four hour chart levels and you're only
00:53:19.990 holding for three days and that's a day
00:53:21.400 trader and then as a swing trader you're
00:53:25.900 to per trade hours two hours per trade
00:53:29.080 and you're doing this often and you're
00:53:30.460 entering on the 4-hour chart and you are
00:53:32.440 using a six to one ratio so you're using
00:53:34.510 a daily chart level
00:53:35.650 six to one ratio here I actually made a
00:53:37.750 mistake on this this should be six to
00:53:39.340 one as well I don't know why I typed
00:53:41.290 four to one these should actually all be
00:53:42.790 six to one they are not four to one
00:53:45.280 ratio they are six to one ratio all of
00:53:48.850 these you gonna edit that right now so
00:53:52.470 this is 6 to 1 and this is also 6 to 1
00:54:02.150 actually six to one and this is six one
00:54:04.190 and I and I I didn't mention four to one
00:54:06.410 because I know this off by heart as six
00:54:08.150 to one but I use six to one not four to
00:54:12.920 one sorry for that mistake so so daily
00:54:15.589 as well so if you break out your 4 hours
00:54:17.779 4 times 6 is 24 which equals a daily
00:54:20.480 chart level which you're holding that
00:54:22.520 point for a total of 1 to 7 days that's
00:54:24.680 a swing trader and hours on a position
00:54:28.160 trader you know is 4 hours per trade and
00:54:31.220 the reason why it's more than a swing
00:54:32.720 traders because you are taking less
00:54:34.099 position so you want to make sure that
00:54:36.349 you are getting you're spending more
00:54:40.400 time on the chart to take a better
00:54:41.779 position because you are looking for a
00:54:43.010 long position now a position trader can
00:54:45.200 be somebody who holds a coin for 5 days
00:54:47.930 it can be somebody who holds a coin for
00:54:49.460 4 months it can be somebody who holds a
00:54:51.140 coin for 2 years a position trader and I
00:54:53.599 just put 1 to 1,000 as kind of a you
00:54:56.480 know broad so that you can see this is
00:54:58.130 it's not a thousand days max it could be
00:55:00.049 10 years right so you can see why taking
00:55:02.779 4 hours per trade on a chart is more
00:55:05.240 important and valuable and you're not
00:55:06.740 doing that often so you might take 4
00:55:08.690 hours twice a week so you might have an
00:55:10.670 8 hour work week if you're a position
00:55:12.349 trader now it's not position traders
00:55:14.809 aren't making a day-to-day income they
00:55:16.910 are making large incremental gains on
00:55:19.220 large periods of time so where that said
00:55:22.430 you understand the hours that you need
00:55:24.140 to put in daily and why you would need
00:55:25.730 to put those in you need 2 to 6 hours
00:55:27.230 daily on a day trader because you're
00:55:29.119 entering different types of positions
00:55:30.859 right so this is the chart to use now I
00:55:34.059 myself personally am all of the above I
00:55:37.130 am a scalper I am a day trader I'm a
00:55:38.960 swing and position trader because I see
00:55:40.910 different positions that I like to take
00:55:43.760 in every single type of trade
00:55:45.170 I have position trade Long's that I do
00:55:48.230 see something and I say this is a good
00:55:49.849 opportunity for a long this is at the
00:55:51.829 beginning of its down move and I'm gonna
00:55:54.020 show you an example of what position
00:55:55.579 trading would look like right we're not
00:55:57.799 going to do a position trade but I will
00:55:59.150 show you an example of where I may have
00:56:00.500 entered on a position trade and where my
00:56:02.040 that may have been let's just click Auto
00:56:03.840 get this thing sorted move this get rid
00:56:09.450 of this guy get rid of that guy I just
00:56:12.270 want to get rid of these red lines and
00:56:13.320 all this other stuff that's not needed
00:56:14.850 these yellow lines don't need don't need
00:56:17.010 don't need
00:56:17.790 it's my anal self being that person oops
00:56:21.300 that I need sorry guys I can't do this
00:56:24.150 without doing this it's just a little
00:56:26.460 thing even that hidden when I got to get
00:56:27.900 them all that's like Pokemon guide catch
00:56:29.820 them all terrible joke ok so a position
00:56:34.200 trade for me would have been a long
00:56:38.340 entry so I know this is a a monthly low
00:56:41.040 as this came through I would not have
00:56:42.570 been buying this candle but on that
00:56:44.280 monthly as soon as this reject that I
00:56:46.080 would have been taking a long position
00:56:47.370 somewhere in here as I got confirmation
00:56:49.710 that this level is holding I would have
00:56:51.270 taken a long position here and my long
00:56:53.190 position would would look to exit
00:56:57.810 here
00:56:59.830 the start of this valley so the start of
00:57:01.810 this downtrend what I know this Valley
00:57:03.880 is going to be in the future I would not
00:57:05.890 have taken exit
00:57:09.380 here on the first wedge of this like
00:57:12.019 right you had two wedges in here you
00:57:13.849 have one rate here right I would not
00:57:16.249 have taken exit somewhere at these
00:57:17.479 levels my exit is here so I wait and I
00:57:19.880 maybe I end up waiting six months this
00:57:21.680 is a position trade right maybe I end up
00:57:23.690 waiting six months and that's okay too
00:57:25.039 but my exit on this position trade is
00:57:27.049 this and I am studying this position
00:57:29.150 trading great depth and I'm waiting a
00:57:30.499 long time for it to happen I might I
00:57:31.699 might I might wait three weeks to take a
00:57:33.920 position I might say you know I've
00:57:37.009 identified this level right we might be
00:57:38.930 on the weekly oh we are in the weekly
00:57:40.130 chart okay so that's perfect here we
00:57:42.469 might be here and I say okay I've seen
00:57:43.910 this as breaking we're in week one week
00:57:45.949 two I see it's holding week three we
00:57:48.289 bounced off a time taking entry right
00:57:50.239 there on week three and you know it
00:57:52.910 might take me three weeks to get into
00:57:54.109 this trade but once I see that
00:57:55.069 confirmation I'm taking that trade for a
00:57:57.259 position trader right or maybe my
00:57:59.329 strategy for this was a scalp and I just
00:58:01.009 or some other kind of trade but for me
00:58:03.410 this is how I would identify position
00:58:05.180 trade so I have spots where I'm
00:58:07.130 identifying these trades right and then
00:58:09.589 going back to this list I have spots
00:58:12.799 where I'm identifying the same thing for
00:58:14.359 everything swing trades where I'm saying
00:58:16.579 I'm in one right now for MTL I'm in a
00:58:18.709 swing trade right now for MTL where I've
00:58:20.299 planned about and I've been in it for
00:58:21.589 about six days now and I'm expecting it
00:58:24.650 to break up right we'll get into that
00:58:27.440 but I'm in a swing trade right now on on
00:58:29.719 one or two coins as well as a position
00:58:31.459 trade on some other coins as well as I'm
00:58:33.289 day trading other coins and scalping so
00:58:35.989 for me I like to do all of these things
00:58:38.660 so you guys decide how how what type of
00:58:43.219 trader you want to be there is no right
00:58:44.690 or wrong for me I like a hybrid model of
00:58:46.640 all of them because I have different
00:58:47.890 ideas as to why and different expertise
00:58:52.249 as to why our mentor in what coin and
00:58:53.660 why so I hope this is a great first
00:58:57.349 lesson for you guys on on levels and the
00:58:59.930 way they work and why they are so
00:59:01.729 important in the end timeframe the
00:59:03.829 theory and the idea of time frame in
00:59:06.049 general and how strong that can be right
00:59:10.160 let's just go over this one last time
00:59:12.049 make sure we covered everything
00:59:13.219 what are time frames well I think you
00:59:15.019 guys know by now time frames are
00:59:16.819 important two levels cover that wire
00:59:18.619 timeframes important to tree
00:59:20.210 and the charge for training so yeah like
00:59:21.770 I said use this chart if you want screen
00:59:23.750 capture do whatever you need to do and I
00:59:25.849 hope you guys enjoyed this lesson go

00:00:19.020 free to do so I post up my daily trades
00:00:21.690 there and the content release and kind
00:00:24.029 of my day to day interactions alright
00:00:26.039 without further ado let's get right into
00:00:27.810 it okay
00:00:30.109 level adaptation now before we get into
00:00:33.629 this I want to start by saying that this
00:00:37.140 is going to be one of the most important
00:00:39.809 lessons within the beginners and
00:00:42.239 advanced course this is going to be one
00:00:44.489 of your golden keys this lesson to
00:00:47.010 understanding how everything works
00:00:48.299 together and it's really gonna tie a lot
00:00:50.609 of these concepts together and kind of
00:00:53.100 put weight everything we've learned so
00:00:56.179 this might be a bit of a lengthy lesson
00:00:59.329 but it is also one of the most important
00:01:01.889 like I said so level adaptation what is
00:01:06.780 level adaptation all right level
00:01:08.640 adaptation is the idea that levels start
00:01:14.370 to take form to the theories that we
00:01:16.140 talked about so we talked about time
00:01:17.490 frames we talked about patterns wedges
00:01:19.830 all these different things like that and
00:01:21.270 level adaptation is is putting weight to
00:01:25.110 the theories that we've learned so you
00:01:28.140 know we identify levels in terms of
00:01:29.820 support resistance in terms of wedges
00:01:32.510 trend lines this and that but we need to
00:01:35.310 adapt these other theories to them we
00:01:37.410 need to start adding a baseline right we
00:01:40.890 are sorry we created our baseline and we
00:01:42.810 need to add to that with all these other
00:01:44.790 theories so we so we attach the two
00:01:46.470 right we take all these theories that we
00:01:47.880 learned throughout the course and the
00:01:49.890 ones that we've learned so far and then
00:01:51.270 in the future when we are further add up
00:01:53.360 adapting our levels and we attach them
00:01:56.490 to that principle of levels so we kind
00:01:59.280 of take the context and and we apply
00:02:02.729 those confines or those bounds to levels
00:02:06.360 okay
00:02:07.820 so that's what level adaptation it's
00:02:09.740 it's kind of a constant evolution of
00:02:11.450 levels and how they they further evolve
00:02:16.550 over time
00:02:17.650 all right level segregation and levels
00:02:20.540 2.0 the refinement of dailies and lower
00:02:23.720 okay so there's a very specific way that
00:02:27.920 I taught levels to begin with and the
00:02:30.350 thing that we did and let's switch over
00:02:32.330 to the chart here I think that we did is
00:02:35.900 we defined our levels from kind of this
00:02:39.830 top-down idea to start right we define
00:02:43.040 monthly levels first because of their
00:02:44.570 strength and we defined weekly levels
00:02:47.930 after that because of their strength
00:02:49.310 relative to monthly and daily levels and
00:02:51.670 okay so before we go any further into
00:02:54.680 this if you haven't watched the previous
00:02:56.150 video stop this right now and watch it
00:02:59.600 first because you will not follow along
00:03:01.430 with this video this this is building
00:03:04.070 off of video 8 which was time frames
00:03:07.070 this is furthering time frames and a
00:03:09.080 building off those theories and actually
00:03:10.820 the whole entire series course 1 through
00:03:15.050 8 you'll need to watch them all and
00:03:16.670 understand them in great detail too to
00:03:18.200 start applying this concept in this
00:03:19.910 lesson because this lesson is so complex
00:03:22.850 and it is tying together so many of
00:03:25.670 these different things that we have
00:03:26.720 learned about if there's something
00:03:30.019 you're not getting go back study it
00:03:32.360 understand it fully and and then come to
00:03:34.790 this this this lesson right now is going
00:03:36.440 to be very dense and context rich it is
00:03:40.100 going to be very important lesson like
00:03:42.320 I've said a few times now it's gonna be
00:03:43.640 one of the most important lessons that
00:03:45.200 there is in the be the most important
00:03:47.780 lesson in the beginners course and and
00:03:49.250 one of the most important throughout the
00:03:51.680 entire course it's one of the golden
00:03:54.230 keys to this entire thing right and
00:03:56.870 there's there's gonna be five or six of
00:03:58.130 those types of videos but this this is
00:03:59.390 one of them so this is kind of a
00:04:00.530 milestone video for people and it's
00:04:02.780 gonna it's gonna give clarity to a lot
00:04:05.209 of the things that we've discussed all
00:04:07.070 right so we've I've taught how to
00:04:11.480 identify and create levels in a very
00:04:13.910 specific manner to get to this point now
00:04:16.880 we are going to refine those levels
00:04:18.470 right we are going to take
00:04:19.750 do love a refinement and further build
00:04:22.720 off what we know so let's just quickly
00:04:24.670 review what we what we talked about
00:04:26.140 performed okay
00:04:28.270 monthly levels we've got the way we've
00:04:31.990 learned it is this that the low and the
00:04:33.640 high of the the candles right so you so
00:04:38.320 you have your swing low candles and
00:04:39.580 you're gonna have the both sides of that
00:04:41.080 right you have the swing low candle and
00:04:42.730 you're gonna have the low of that candle
00:04:45.340 and the high in this case we didn't put
00:04:47.590 the high on and you can go back and
00:04:48.820 watch the previous video to find out why
00:04:50.890 and then we have the swing high of the
00:04:53.650 high candle and the swing low of that
00:04:55.810 high candle then we have our swing low
00:04:59.410 candle down so we have the swing low of
00:05:02.320 that low candle and the swing high which
00:05:04.570 is this level right here so this doesn't
00:05:06.310 actually have its own second level it's
00:05:07.660 just a testing of this of the section it
00:05:09.220 has one level and then as we further
00:05:11.800 traverse down this we have this swing
00:05:14.200 low monthly candle right here right we
00:05:16.990 have the swing low of that low candle
00:05:19.210 and the swing high okay and we did the
00:05:21.310 same thing for weeklies we further dove
00:05:24.970 into this and we identified that on
00:05:26.979 weekly levels right so we had the swing
00:05:30.130 low on the weekly which was here which
00:05:31.510 was a monthly level so we identified
00:05:33.070 just the top side of that as a weekly
00:05:35.020 level okay then we had the swing high of
00:05:38.650 the move and on the weekly that would
00:05:40.840 have been the swing low but on the
00:05:42.970 monthly the swing low was actually back
00:05:44.620 here now again if you're not following
00:05:46.150 this go back to the previous video watch
00:05:48.100 how we identified the swing high and
00:05:50.110 lows and you'll be able to follow it no
00:05:52.090 problem you'll see you'll see exactly
00:05:53.169 how and why as I step through it but
00:05:55.750 this is just a recap because this is
00:05:57.130 going to be very important going forward
00:05:58.479 to this lesson okay so and then after
00:06:01.030 this swing high we have this swing loom
00:06:02.620 here so we have the bottom side on the
00:06:03.940 top side and so forth so you guys can
00:06:05.860 see how these levels were identified and
00:06:10.120 and you can follow this so forth and so
00:06:12.310 forth so then we left our Manero chart
00:06:14.560 and we're gonna be working with the same
00:06:15.580 chart that we had at the time frames
00:06:17.850 chart with the exclusion that I removed
00:06:21.580 the daily levels because the daily
00:06:23.500 levels are what we are going to refine
00:06:25.000 and there is a segregation that happens
00:06:28.210 between levels the way I taught levels
00:06:31.000 is that you
00:06:32.770 again this was a very specific way I
00:06:34.150 taught this because I wanted you guys to
00:06:35.500 see how to identify the top and bottoms
00:06:39.879 of swing lows and swing highs okay so it
00:06:42.729 was very important that we started by
00:06:44.830 learning the basic part of this which is
00:06:47.199 what we just said the swing was in highs
00:06:49.300 up both sides of the up and down moves
00:06:50.949 right and then we needed to see how to
00:06:54.909 identify those levels on a daily as well
00:06:57.550 okay so so we I like I said I taught it
00:07:00.520 in a very specific way to open people's
00:07:02.800 eyes to start seeing where these levels
00:07:04.720 are without further refining them too
00:07:08.860 too too quickly because if you can't
00:07:11.470 understand the basics of the moves you
00:07:13.780 won't grasp the further concepts and
00:07:15.490 this is going to be the refinement of
00:07:17.199 those levels now what does it mean when
00:07:20.050 there's level segregation it just like
00:07:21.909 anything any other type of segregation
00:07:23.080 there's a split right there's there's
00:07:24.880 two sides of this thing there's the
00:07:26.759 monthly and weekly levels and then
00:07:29.530 there's the daily and under okay so
00:07:31.810 that's the segregation right there is
00:07:33.520 monthly and weekly and daily and under
00:07:37.659 okay so that's the segregation of levels
00:07:40.120 now what does that mean you guys can see
00:07:42.520 right here on our monthly and weekly
00:07:44.289 chart we have created the levels and
00:07:47.080 identified this as we just said as we
00:07:49.840 just walk through okay now if we swap
00:07:52.029 over to the daily and you notice I have
00:07:53.620 one daily line starting here I'm like I
00:07:56.139 said I removed everything else from our
00:07:57.340 Manero chart that we worked on yesterday
00:07:59.430 because we're gonna be changing that up
00:08:01.360 a bit I have one level to identify where
00:08:04.659 this is gonna start right because we
00:08:05.979 talked about this yesterday or sorry the
00:08:08.380 last video I should say not yesterday it
00:08:10.000 was yesterday for me but the last video
00:08:11.669 in the last video we talked about this
00:08:14.080 right where we went through all this
00:08:16.120 this chain of events and we identified
00:08:18.190 the tops and bottoms of these levels we
00:08:20.349 are no longer going to be doing that
00:08:22.630 with daily levels there is a different
00:08:24.909 way to do this with daily and under and
00:08:27.219 that's the way and not the way but that
00:08:29.710 is the segregation between levels so we
00:08:32.500 are going to walk through this move and
00:08:34.029 how we are identifying daily levels now
00:08:36.219 so this is a refinement of our levels if
00:08:37.929 we kind of switch back to this here
00:08:41.328 and we look at this so that's the level
00:08:44.360 of segregation and this is gonna be
00:08:45.920 levels 2.0 the refinement of the dailies
00:08:48.799 and lowers right so this is again just
00:08:52.730 just to be very clear monthly and weekly
00:08:54.529 have one set of rules and dailies and
00:08:56.809 less so everything from the 15-minute to
00:08:59.029 the daily candles have a different set
00:09:00.709 of rules okay so let's go back to our
00:09:03.860 chart
00:09:07.070 so the way we identify daily levels is
00:09:09.880 they do not have a swing high and swing
00:09:13.399 low on both sides of the move so we are
00:09:16.550 gonna walk through this okay and we are
00:09:18.860 gonna start right here hey swing high
00:09:21.560 right here we already know this is a
00:09:23.300 monthly level so we're starting here we
00:09:24.769 come down we already know this is a
00:09:26.269 level so we're not gonna mark that as
00:09:27.740 anything the swing high of the level is
00:09:29.810 gonna be our first daily level that we
00:09:31.459 mark and that's obvious it gets
00:09:33.889 respected right there now as we go down
00:09:36.199 through this right we're gonna explain
00:09:38.000 why we're doing what we're doing so just
00:09:40.040 follow along for now we go down and the
00:09:42.319 next swing low is a level Magna tools on
00:09:47.810 so the next swing low is a level that we
00:09:53.029 have our first level and then the swing
00:09:55.399 high would have been here and it
00:09:56.269 actually just touched the level so this
00:09:57.829 is kind of a zone that gets created
00:09:59.569 right the swing high to the swing low if
00:10:01.790 we were doing it the traditional way we
00:10:03.920 would have marked the top side of this
00:10:05.180 candle and we would have marked the
00:10:06.500 bottom side of this candle this does not
00:10:08.690 work whoops all training view this does
00:10:13.850 not work on daily levels because you
00:10:15.620 start to have too many levels all over
00:10:17.300 your charts and all over your draft this
00:10:19.250 is only prevalent and relevant to
00:10:21.230 dailies and weekly levels because there
00:10:23.149 are such strong levels because as we
00:10:25.310 discussed in timeframe and kind of level
00:10:27.560 strength they are such strong levels
00:10:29.690 that both sides of those have that up
00:10:32.420 and bottom that that top and bottom side
00:10:34.279 and the reason being is because when
00:10:35.600 you're on a daily or a weekly level
00:10:37.190 right just go back to the weekly here
00:10:39.110 for a second so we can talk about why
00:10:40.839 okay let's let's just go take a look at
00:10:43.370 one okay so this one right here it's
00:10:44.480 just whatever's in the middle of my
00:10:45.560 screen so the top side of this is twenty
00:10:49.130 eight thousand four hundred and seventy
00:10:50.149 one sats and the bottom side of this is
00:10:52.490 twenty three thousand what is that oh I
00:10:55.459 give because I could just move the mouse
00:10:57.050 and look right here is a twenty four so
00:11:00.319 cut twenty four thousand on the bottom
00:11:02.209 side of this candle and on the top side
00:11:03.800 we have twenty eight thousand five
00:11:06.139 hundred so we have a forty five hundred
00:11:08.389 SAP difference that's twenty percent
00:11:11.029 difference in you know if your start if
00:11:13.399 you start breaking down these daily
00:11:16.790 candles in that
00:11:18.220 well let's go take a look we know the
00:11:20.080 weekly is 20% because that's kind of the
00:11:22.240 range that week these a month these live
00:11:23.590 in and month these are going to be you
00:11:24.550 know 50% sometimes or 200% or whatever
00:11:27.190 right so let's go back to this and if we
00:11:29.770 were to break this down let's get this
00:11:32.260 nice and centered on our screen if we
00:11:35.320 were to break this down right we have
00:11:37.420 this wing top the the swing high here
00:11:39.430 right and we have the swing high there
00:11:45.610 right and then we have this and would
00:11:48.040 have been this right here what is that
00:11:51.180 300 sacks that's not enough and that's
00:11:55.420 why we are not using what is that a
00:11:58.690 percent half yeah that's a percent and a
00:12:01.720 half three hundred cents that's why we
00:12:04.180 are not using the tops and bottoms of
00:12:07.450 all these daily candles instead we are
00:12:09.100 creating zones okay so this right here
00:12:11.650 is a zone
00:12:13.730 this is the zone that this lives in it's
00:12:16.100 the swing high and the swing low right
00:12:19.850 and that's what we are marking and we
00:12:21.380 are going to step through this right
00:12:22.580 because there's a few rules that we need
00:12:23.900 to learn about and and discuss ok so we
00:12:28.070 start here we marked the swing high we
00:12:29.570 then mark the swing low we would have
00:12:31.220 marked this swing high if it went to
00:12:33.110 past this level that is the rule when it
00:12:36.020 wicks past this level that was created
00:12:38.630 in that zone it is being marked on the
00:12:40.970 next as as a new swing high right can
00:12:44.390 you kind of like you're gaining that
00:12:45.560 high so and that's another concept we'll
00:12:48.020 go over in advanced lessons it's called
00:12:49.610 gaining the high right so this is not
00:12:52.880 going to be a level obviously because it
00:12:54.260 just touched our previous level it is
00:12:56.480 only going to be a level if that whipped
00:12:57.950 up right and then it will be another
00:12:59.390 level so as we come down the next swing
00:13:02.660 low is here let's toss our magnet tool
00:13:05.210 back on good old magnet tool ok and our
00:13:08.570 swing high on this move is right here
00:13:13.430 just expand this out of it so we can
00:13:15.410 start to see the chart as this song as
00:13:17.720 it's evolved through
00:13:21.760 so our swing high we have a low here our
00:13:25.060 swing high is mega tools being a little
00:13:28.120 funny right there is that the swing high
00:13:31.930 let me double check swing low we have
00:13:34.420 another no that's not because we would
00:13:38.230 have had to break this level up here we
00:13:39.910 would have had to actually wick hiss
00:13:42.160 whoops
00:13:44.389 we would have had to actually whip that
00:13:45.980 level to make a swing high level so
00:13:47.329 actually this is the zone that's created
00:13:49.100 that this lives in okay we have a swing
00:13:51.739 low here now this is important because I
00:13:53.420 want to put the replayer tool on here
00:13:55.639 for this if we were to look at this
00:13:58.549 right and we were to step through this
00:14:00.619 during the moment we have that's where
00:14:03.319 the swing low is created that is not
00:14:06.049 wicking this up here okay
00:14:07.850 so let's step through this that's a new
00:14:09.879 swing low okay so now let's do this
00:14:13.309 we're gonna mark out this swing well
00:14:14.839 right here but look at this this now
00:14:18.259 wicks this level so that is actually
00:14:20.509 creating another level because it
00:14:22.129 follows the rule member when we said we
00:14:24.079 are living in that zone that square
00:14:25.910 that's created that the same zone is
00:14:27.739 created here right this same zone is
00:14:30.739 living right here so when we wick pass
00:14:32.540 this we are creating a new level so that
00:14:36.319 is where you can see the swing low gets
00:14:38.600 created here and actually wicks past
00:14:39.980 this even though it's a tiny level you
00:14:42.319 know it's only three hundred SATs this
00:14:43.610 is a swing low and a new level under
00:14:45.079 Wicca pass so that is the rule and that
00:14:46.999 is how it is used when you wick passed
00:14:48.980 your zone that you're in right just like
00:14:51.350 we have a zone here just like we have a
00:14:52.970 zone here you are creating a new high
00:14:55.220 because you are almost it's almost like
00:14:56.869 you're gaining the high and and that's
00:14:58.579 another concept for a future lesson we
00:15:01.850 want to exit this right now yes because
00:15:03.470 I wanted to just kind of go over that
00:15:04.879 and show you guys that and immediately
00:15:08.569 we can see that this swing law was being
00:15:11.119 respected here here all through here in
00:15:13.970 this zone right now where we are this
00:15:16.429 swing low is being respected as it comes
00:15:18.889 down right as it tries to push back up
00:15:20.989 over this swing high is being respected
00:15:23.689 in here right here right here right here
00:15:25.489 so these are this is how you properly
00:15:27.110 identify levels and it's very important
00:15:30.049 that segregation between daily and less
00:15:34.579 so 15 to daily right that 15 to daily
00:15:37.569 timeframe that we identified and then
00:15:40.519 weekly and monthly because of the
00:15:42.350 strength of levels right so this is
00:15:44.059 gonna help start clean up your guys
00:15:45.410 charts a lot right and like I said it
00:15:48.199 was done like this purposefully because
00:15:49.790 it would be too much to expect people
00:15:51.739 who don't understand levels at all to go
00:15:54.259 and start marking out every single level
00:15:55.910 this stuff is
00:15:58.120 this dish is best served over time you
00:16:00.920 cannot wait what's this thing this this
00:16:03.110 dishes bessert cold so that's not the
00:16:05.240 saying at all but you guys get what this
00:16:08.029 this five course meal is served over the
00:16:11.630 appetizer the I don't know the salad I
00:16:15.230 guess it would be whatever doesn't
00:16:16.820 matter I'm gonna move on because that
00:16:18.380 was a terrible joke okay
00:16:20.420 so there's also going to be quite a few
00:16:24.230 more lessons on levels as well this is
00:16:26.870 not the final lesson on level there's
00:16:28.730 probably four more I can count three at
00:16:31.010 least all with theories just as
00:16:36.110 important if not more important than
00:16:37.910 this so we are gonna constantly adapt
00:16:40.550 and add this idea of adaptation to our
00:16:43.550 levels as we are going over the more
00:16:46.579 advanced nuances and how these work at
00:16:48.230 an advanced level so let's continue this
00:16:50.180 move I don't want to get too caught up
00:16:52.519 in rambling because this is going to be
00:16:54.560 a very long video as it is because it is
00:16:56.079 such an important set of concepts so let
00:16:58.790 me create a new swing low there we come
00:17:00.560 up we break that right here we create
00:17:02.870 that new high this is coming down right
00:17:05.030 I think that tools being funny I don't
00:17:09.050 know what's going on with tradingview
00:17:10.010 it's being very funny okay we make a new
00:17:11.750 swing low right here this is another
00:17:13.490 level right this is a swing low as we
00:17:17.599 are moving up after it right we are
00:17:20.419 moving over it
00:17:22.700 see you have a swing low there and you
00:17:24.530 actually move up so there's three one
00:17:27.109 two three candles on the daily that are
00:17:28.580 higher than that so that is a swing low
00:17:30.680 okay this right here right this right
00:17:35.300 here is not a level this is not a level
00:17:38.870 because it's not a swing high
00:17:42.540 hey you see how this is a swing hi you
00:17:45.390 see how this attempts to be a swing hi
00:17:47.760 this is not a level where did it go
00:17:51.090 where are we right here
00:17:52.559 this is not a swing hi
00:17:55.500 this is just a continuation of this
00:17:56.909 downtrend so this would have been a
00:17:58.350 level right there but that was either
00:18:00.510 marking a monthly level that might have
00:18:02.490 marked I'm not I don't recall if this
00:18:04.559 mark to the monthly level it looks like
00:18:06.030 it probably did but regardless that's
00:18:08.490 the level right there we come up we test
00:18:10.350 this level it's not a swing loan this is
00:18:13.530 too close in proximity to this level
00:18:16.320 right here this is not a swing low level
00:18:18.210 right here oh wait yes it is 1573 1559
00:18:22.230 this is a swing low level my mistake
00:18:25.559 we actually have an attempt at a swing
00:18:27.990 height here so this is this is a swing
00:18:29.460 low this is a level here this is a daily
00:18:31.020 level yep so swing low we come up we
00:18:33.990 come down you have another swing well
00:18:35.309 right here this is a level right here we
00:18:39.750 would pass this this is a level you see
00:18:41.970 how we are living in this zone right
00:18:43.200 here between these Davi levels right
00:18:53.179 right here that is a level because we
00:18:56.389 are working past right we create this
00:18:58.669 and we we regain that level right there
00:19:00.950 so this level back here that established
00:19:03.019 our our swing low we are passing that
00:19:06.320 right here making that a level okay and
00:19:08.779 you can see on the chart that it is
00:19:10.940 actually a level right so understanding
00:19:14.029 these zones and how and how this starts
00:19:16.099 to break out that this is this is how
00:19:19.009 you guys have to now adjust what you've
00:19:21.200 learned and and adapt the way that you
00:19:24.229 guys are making levels okay let's
00:19:26.330 continue on okay we got here we got a
00:19:28.309 swing over here
00:19:31.250 and we got a swing high right here and
00:19:32.930 this would be another level as it
00:19:36.680 what's past Louisville right that's
00:19:39.200 another daily level right there you've
00:19:41.120 got quite a bit of Louisville congestion
00:19:42.740 here which is which is actually okay it
00:19:44.750 looks like level congestion here but
00:19:46.220 when you start breaking this down into a
00:19:47.510 15-minute chart we're gonna do that
00:19:48.920 later it's not level congestion right
00:19:51.860 and then you come up and all this here
00:19:55.010 is our well okay well let's just step
00:19:56.810 through it yeah this is not this looks
00:20:00.470 like Louisville congestion because we
00:20:01.820 are looking at a range of thirteen
00:20:03.170 thousand SATs all the way up to 19,000
00:20:06.230 that's what is that six thousand so it's
00:20:08.360 on thirteen thousand that's just a
00:20:09.770 little bit under was that like 45
00:20:11.570 percent or forty forty six or something
00:20:13.160 like that or 44 no I guess I could just
00:20:16.550 use my tool to see right we are looking
00:20:18.800 at a range of well if we go to the very
00:20:20.990 top sixty percent if we go here 45
00:20:23.870 percent so we are looking at a very
00:20:25.130 large range this looks like congestion
00:20:27.920 but as you break this down this is
00:20:30.620 actually not that congested just you
00:20:33.200 know what appear to be so on this chart
00:20:34.960 so let's continue we make a swing low
00:20:39.260 level right here right so here
00:20:45.200 we come up up this is a test of that
00:20:47.540 level you come up right make swing low
00:20:50.630 we test that level we come back up
00:20:52.430 so our levels are pretty pretty defined
00:20:53.990 now when you don't we don't really have
00:20:55.190 any more levels being created because
00:20:56.570 they were all kind of created back in
00:20:57.740 this beginning of this downtrend rate
00:21:00.890 here which is very common and that's the
00:21:02.690 way this works right you create levels
00:21:04.190 in the downtrend on the way down and you
00:21:05.600 respect them on the way up trying to
00:21:06.770 break them they are the targets right so
00:21:09.020 you know very very common there is one
00:21:11.660 level in here as I'm looking at this so
00:21:13.130 we have have here swing swing along here
00:21:14.930 that's on the monthly that's not a level
00:21:17.090 we come up this is a level right here
00:21:19.070 you see how this is the zone it's living
00:21:22.340 in right
00:21:23.300 this is alone right here okay wait let
00:21:26.540 me double check that okay we've got the
00:21:30.140 swing low now this is where you have to
00:21:32.840 kind of okay so this is the zone it's
00:21:34.340 living in great
00:21:39.800 don't I feel about my mega tool so this
00:21:42.110 is a zone it's living in right here it
00:21:43.880 works past this is not a level
00:21:48.240 this is not a level right here it would
00:21:50.250 have had to wick pass this
00:21:56.620 no it is a level my mistake that is a
00:21:59.980 level right there
00:22:01.940 as it wicks past the zone that it's in
00:22:04.640 and that's part of the process is going
00:22:07.400 and identifying where you are in these
00:22:10.190 levels and what the zone you are in and
00:22:11.960 and this this using these boxes in this
00:22:14.510 tool will help you identify because it's
00:22:16.250 not always clear right because you have
00:22:17.600 so much going on you have to start using
00:22:20.630 kind of this box and identifying the
00:22:22.130 zone that you're in now the zone would
00:22:24.500 be between those two daily levels
00:22:27.870 okay so let's continue on we come down
00:22:31.270 we come up we come down we come up this
00:22:32.770 is all respecting levels and this is
00:22:36.130 part of time framing right this is this
00:22:37.900 is part of the process now if we were to
00:22:39.460 switch this over to the hourly chart
00:22:40.660 let's just take a look at something here
00:22:42.760 and ignore that for now so something I
00:22:46.059 was doing tonight I will just delete
00:22:47.530 that so let's take a look at this and
00:22:50.860 see how this looks with our levels so
00:22:53.170 now that we've identified kind of this
00:22:55.950 level segregation if you want to call it
00:22:58.870 and and the way these levels are working
00:23:00.910 between levels let's let's take a look
00:23:02.380 right and you can see
00:23:08.980 you can see well we'll just we'll just
00:23:10.390 start and anywhere it doesn't matter you
00:23:12.250 can see sure we'll start here you can
00:23:15.130 see that your price is is pretty much
00:23:18.940 100% respecting these levels right this
00:23:21.340 level is respected here it's never gonna
00:23:24.910 end with this mega duel I swear to God
00:23:26.580 you can see the prices respected on this
00:23:29.020 level it comes up a test this level
00:23:30.880 comes back down tests this comes back up
00:23:33.220 to test the weekly comes back down and
00:23:35.830 kind of sits in this zone here it comes
00:23:39.130 up test this level here breaks the
00:23:41.530 weekly comes back down tests this here
00:23:43.390 comes tests that there test this weekly
00:23:45.610 test this daily right so you guys can
00:23:48.549 see that as you go through this these
00:23:50.620 levels are being pretty well respected
00:23:54.160 100% of the time right it's it's you
00:23:56.169 know you can see a constantly test in
00:23:57.790 this area here all the way through and
00:23:59.230 it lives in this kind of this short
00:24:01.179 little box here that's created and after
00:24:03.820 that little short box it lives in this
00:24:05.530 short box right and it loses this level
00:24:08.260 here not only does it lose this here
00:24:11.230 right but it loses this here so it goes
00:24:13.720 down to the next level so you can see
00:24:15.370 how kind of clearing up these levels and
00:24:17.679 and making your chart less is more
00:24:19.780 right you can see and we're going to
00:24:21.100 continue that principle in this in this
00:24:22.630 video you can see how the the process of
00:24:26.530 clearing up this chart and now taking
00:24:29.140 only some of all of them is taking away
00:24:30.850 all those swing highs and lows it's
00:24:32.950 helping identify this a little clearer
00:24:34.450 right that segregation of levels helps
00:24:37.299 with this okay
00:24:39.340 so that is how we adapt our levels to
00:24:43.929 timeframes right we are looking at and
00:24:46.090 that's the the adaptation that we are
00:24:47.830 doing here we have taken the concept of
00:24:49.779 time frames right what we talked about
00:24:51.909 in the last video we have taken that
00:24:53.080 concept of time frames and we have
00:24:54.820 adapted it in two levels right so level
00:24:58.419 adaptation with time frames says that we
00:25:01.299 should have a segregation between
00:25:02.799 monthly and weekly being in one sector
00:25:06.519 and then the next sector down a
00:25:08.249 segregation from that concept of time
00:25:10.720 frames that daily to 15-minute will live
00:25:14.169 in a different set of rules which is
00:25:15.610 exactly what's happening here
00:25:16.869 so let's you know I hate having all this
00:25:20.710 stuff on my chart so let's get rid of it
00:25:22.119 for now and we can swap to the four hour
00:25:24.009 and you know the same thing we can see
00:25:27.159 the four hour chart it is it is having
00:25:29.889 that it is fighting the same fight doing
00:25:31.480 the same battle with these levels right
00:25:33.070 it is bouncing between this level here
00:25:35.470 going up crossing this right coming down
00:25:37.509 to test this level coming up to test
00:25:39.279 this and for anybody who doubts these
00:25:41.470 levels I really want you to look at
00:25:43.690 where these tests are and I'm gonna put
00:25:45.100 a green strike through the tests on the
00:25:47.139 levels right that's right there that's
00:25:50.289 right there right that's right there
00:25:52.570 that's right there that's right there
00:25:55.179 right that's right there right here
00:25:58.409 that's right here test right here test
00:26:01.210 right there right so you can see test
00:26:03.580 right there and and then it lives in
00:26:05.559 this kind of this congested congested
00:26:08.049 zone in here but still within that tests
00:26:11.259 all through their class through their
00:26:13.029 tests there sits kind of on this line
00:26:16.090 test their test their test there right
00:26:18.940 so it's on this line test that sits
00:26:22.090 there test that loses it test this tries
00:26:25.360 to regain this up here loses not only
00:26:27.879 this but this is well causing a huge
00:26:30.509 move down to the next level you know you
00:26:32.740 notice something pretty interesting
00:26:33.940 right here is we never identified a
00:26:35.320 level in this zone right here right this
00:26:37.299 whole idea of level congestion is you
00:26:41.110 know it are the levels really congested
00:26:42.909 and how accurate is this well let's look
00:26:44.619 at this when we lost this level right
00:26:46.389 here did we stop at any point in here at
00:26:48.429 all right did we did we stop anywhere in
00:26:50.860 there no we didn't because
00:26:52.080 we test it down on the next level and
00:26:53.789 then from there we test down on this
00:26:55.500 level and then we test their monthly and
00:26:56.970 then we try to come back and test up a
00:26:58.470 high here right and then we still live
00:27:01.470 and this right whoops we don't want to
00:27:05.789 do that let's get our pen tool back here
00:27:08.130 right so then you know it is this Zone
00:27:12.809 in here a level and is this really a
00:27:14.580 level right here well let's look as we
00:27:16.140 keep going forward is this a level yeah
00:27:19.200 it looks like it to me
00:27:20.070 is this a level yep is this the level
00:27:22.110 yep look at this bounce bounce and down
00:27:25.490 tests come up test test test
00:27:29.519 come up and over bounce test come up
00:27:32.309 test come up test right so that should
00:27:39.990 be pretty glaringly obvious that these
00:27:44.669 levels are real and these levels are the
00:27:48.269 exact way they are and this is the
00:27:50.610 science behind these levels and it can
00:27:53.309 be seen on the charts no matter what you
00:27:55.740 do right you can see it on these charts
00:27:57.750 and you notice there's nothing in here
00:27:59.610 right you want to see something else you
00:28:02.700 are testing this low right here
00:28:06.240 if you would have lost this low that
00:28:08.909 started this up move no this is just a
00:28:10.559 little tidbit for for the advanced stuff
00:28:12.330 those are like a little nail biter
00:28:13.529 teaser I don't know whatever you want to
00:28:15.120 call it if you would have lost the low
00:28:17.070 that started the movie you would have
00:28:18.330 tested down here somewhere
00:28:19.470 you would have lost the low that sat on
00:28:21.600 the monthly level if you lost this low
00:28:23.250 here you would have tested down here we
00:28:24.809 would have enough pretty ferocious dumb
00:28:26.029 little teaser for a future future lesson
00:28:28.769 just to keep you guys your interest
00:28:30.600 piqued not that it already wasn't but
00:28:32.309 just to kind of give you a little tidbit
00:28:35.240 okay let's move on so that reduces a lot
00:28:39.570 of this congestion with levels okay
00:28:42.289 that's level segregation and and the way
00:28:45.000 it works right we've kind of talked it
00:28:49.350 to death now moving on time framing
00:28:52.169 levels now this is something that's
00:28:53.909 really interesting so that whole concept
00:28:56.279 of congestion is it's very important
00:28:58.260 because as we go through this course you
00:29:00.120 are going to see that less is more
00:29:01.850 and as we look at these levels we have
00:29:04.190 to kind of look at them with a good
00:29:06.590 clarity in mind to see what's happening
00:29:08.539 if we have too much going on right if we
00:29:10.850 have too many of this too many of that
00:29:12.200 too many levels let's let's go to the
00:29:13.789 weekly and see what this thing looks
00:29:17.120 like on a weekly okay
00:29:22.090 I don't know I don't know what you can
00:29:25.090 make of this in the weekly because like
00:29:27.280 look at this is working perfect for a
00:29:29.290 daily chart this is working perfect for
00:29:31.480 like a 4-hour chart oh it's a six hour
00:29:34.390 12 hour chart even a 15 minutes or 1
00:29:36.820 hour 2 hour whatever time frame between
00:29:38.920 daily and 15 even a 1-minute chart right
00:29:41.080 even a 30 second chart like a tick chart
00:29:44.340 it's working fine because you can you
00:29:47.050 can see the process of these levels
00:29:49.420 being respected as we walk through this
00:29:52.420 this whole time you can see that process
00:29:55.540 being respected but all the sudden you
00:29:57.010 switch over to a weekly it's like whoa
00:29:59.460 like what the heck is going on I can't
00:30:02.320 see anything what do I make of this this
00:30:04.450 this is this is insanity and then even
00:30:06.310 worse you go to the monthly and it's
00:30:07.990 like
00:30:10.559 it just becomes this the soup of levels
00:30:13.049 and it's impossible to see so we now do
00:30:15.929 something else okay right we are now get
00:30:20.190 a time frame out our levels right this
00:30:22.320 is something very specific time framing
00:30:24.120 levels okay so what we are going to do
00:30:26.220 is we are going to time frame these
00:30:28.559 levels okay so what does that mean I
00:30:33.450 will show you what that means and it's
00:30:35.009 pretty cool
00:30:39.720 what we end up doing here is called time
00:30:43.200 framing we pick this level now this is
00:30:45.179 this is I this is exclusive to trading
00:30:47.519 view I don't know how other softwares
00:30:49.409 handle it I don't know the command
00:30:50.730 prompt to the sequence of events or
00:30:52.919 however you get to these features on
00:30:54.539 other sites or software's or charts but
00:30:57.059 on this is this is for trading view this
00:30:59.070 is how I know it right if you double
00:31:01.529 click this level you can do this to any
00:31:04.379 level that you do any wedge any trend
00:31:06.269 any level right if I was a double click
00:31:08.309 this one it gives me different
00:31:09.690 parameters if I double click this level
00:31:11.909 in the visibility you have parameters of
00:31:16.590 properties that you can change right so
00:31:18.990 if I wanted to say these red levels
00:31:21.750 these daily levels I don't want them to
00:31:25.320 be visible on a weekly chart I don't
00:31:27.389 want them to be visible on a monthly
00:31:28.830 chart I just want them to be visible
00:31:32.059 from one day right between 1 and 24
00:31:37.139 hours right so it's gonna show me on the
00:31:39.059 daily it's gonna show me 1 to 24 hours I
00:31:41.070 could even put this at 12 and it would
00:31:42.419 still work the same because a 12 hour
00:31:45.149 chart is all I use but we'll just leave
00:31:46.409 it at 24 for this and one minute to 59
00:31:51.269 minutes so I want this visible on a
00:31:53.250 1-minute chart on an hourly chart and a
00:31:55.049 daily chart ok if I put this to 7 it
00:31:57.090 would technically make it a weekly so
00:31:58.320 that's the way this works and I'm gonna
00:31:59.309 hit ok so now this top level if we
00:32:02.009 switch it over to the weekly you notice
00:32:04.350 that is gone this is very important that
00:32:08.730 is gone so let's go back to this we
00:32:11.220 ticked off the weekly be ticked off the
00:32:12.840 monthly we're gonna go to template and
00:32:14.279 save as and I say this already is daily
00:32:16.529 level but we will save it again
00:32:19.769 sure why not we'll just call it the same
00:32:21.389 thing daily level and it's already color
00:32:23.429 coded red the way we like it for our
00:32:24.990 daily levels and all that stuff and
00:32:26.940 we're gonna overwrite that template sure
00:32:28.559 so now this is gonna be a little tedious
00:32:30.509 because we are gonna have to go through
00:32:32.250 every single one of these and we are
00:32:33.899 gonna have to change that template on
00:32:35.879 them to daily levels right
00:32:38.910 so go through them we change this one
00:32:42.210 let's do this one
00:32:46.100 unfun fun we do this one here probably
00:32:50.550 about halfway through now
00:32:54.820 let's just quickly pop over and see how
00:32:56.649 that's cleaning it up uh huh you see we
00:32:59.230 are cleaning it up quick right this is
00:33:01.240 uh this is housecleaning this is how you
00:33:02.860 guys are gonna have to start setting
00:33:05.019 their levels on a day-to-day basis right
00:33:07.269 every time you are charting I want you
00:33:08.950 to start building all these templates
00:33:10.360 and use my daily levels as your first
00:33:12.580 template right I want you guys to have
00:33:15.880 these daily levels only visible on the
00:33:19.350 days hours and minutes if these are not
00:33:22.960 relevant for weekly and monthly charts
00:33:25.929 it is just a soup like I said daily
00:33:28.299 level here and I think that's the last
00:33:31.059 one maybe this one we didn't get no we
00:33:34.419 didn't get this one okay so let's see
00:33:35.860 how that looks aha look at that we have
00:33:39.250 a clean weekly chart like magic we now
00:33:43.480 have a clean weekly chart where we can
00:33:45.070 see what's actually happening on our
00:33:46.960 weekly chart we can see look at this
00:33:50.639 Magneto's not on it's still being funny
00:33:52.720 what's going on okay you know what you
00:33:55.600 can see right we touch down this level
00:33:57.789 here we break over this weekly we come
00:34:00.220 down and touch this monthly we are
00:34:01.750 testing this weekly right now we don't
00:34:03.970 have this mass confusion going on in our
00:34:08.020 charts now we can we can promptly switch
00:34:11.770 between daily monthly and the monthly we
00:34:14.619 want to keep the weekly levels on two
00:34:15.879 because in the monthly level the
00:34:16.869 weeklies our respective right now we can
00:34:20.679 see what's actually going on in our
00:34:22.179 charts we don't have this overflow of
00:34:24.730 levels in this this congestion that
00:34:26.139 always happens and as we switch to the
00:34:27.819 daily those levels are back for us and
00:34:29.980 as we switch down to the four-hour those
00:34:31.540 levels are still there in the 15-minute
00:34:32.949 and so forth so that is the cleaning up
00:34:37.000 and and the the time framing of levels
00:34:41.560 okay now this is just support and
00:34:43.480 resistance the time framing of levels
00:34:45.159 actually overflows into everything so if
00:34:49.030 you remember yesterday I wanna see I
00:34:50.589 keep saying yesterday night yesterday
00:34:52.030 last video if you remember on the last
00:34:54.940 video we specifically set this wedge
00:34:57.640 purple right because this wedge right we
00:35:01.690 identified this wedge first and the
00:35:04.089 biggest time frame on the weekly that
00:35:05.650 was where it was visible okay
00:35:07.470 the same principle applies to wedges and
00:35:11.550 the same principle applies to all the
00:35:14.340 trend lines that recreate the same
00:35:15.990 principle applies to all the levels
00:35:20.400 wedges trends patterns valleys
00:35:22.530 everything that's a level which is all
00:35:24.330 of the above that I just mentioned this
00:35:26.490 applies to so an example of that would
00:35:28.560 be if we were on a 15-minute chart okay
00:35:31.140 and let's use yellow we're gonna use
00:35:33.780 yellow for the 15-minute term let's hit
00:35:35.190 the auto button that will scale us
00:35:37.200 nicely right now okay
00:35:39.780 let's see what's going on with Manero
00:35:40.890 here what has happened let's make some
00:35:44.400 trends okay
00:35:45.810 we have this trend here swing low to the
00:35:48.900 next swing low right here that is a
00:35:51.450 trend and we are now going to use yellow
00:35:54.150 right okay let's switch the color of
00:35:57.150 this to yellow okay now we only want
00:36:02.750 this on the hours weeks and minutes okay
00:36:09.000 sorry we only want this on the hours and
00:36:12.180 in minutes so one hour to 24 hours and
00:36:15.390 those minutes we don't need this on the
00:36:16.950 daily the 15 minutes not going to bleed
00:36:18.390 over into the daily so we don't want to
00:36:19.890 see on our daily levels when we were
00:36:21.570 looking at this let's just switch that
00:36:24.000 back on and you'll see why we don't want
00:36:25.800 to see it right so we have one kind of
00:36:28.710 trend right there it looks like
00:36:34.410 yes here
00:36:38.900 that right there well actually it would
00:36:41.540 be the first kind of one which is right
00:36:44.510 there oh boy it's been a little funny
00:36:47.780 we're just gonna quick it to that one so
00:36:49.070 you know these trends we can see right
00:36:51.620 we've got this trend bounces balances
00:36:53.660 bounces rejects off a level right here
00:36:55.970 rejects off the daily so so this is you
00:36:58.460 know if you were to go to this move and
00:37:00.320 this is a little bit off the beaten path
00:37:01.910 but this is you know we'll walk through
00:37:03.110 this for a second right if you were in
00:37:07.370 this movement here and you saw you know
00:37:10.160 that the swing low that started the up
00:37:11.990 move here and that's where you would
00:37:14.360 have identified this right here is the
00:37:16.040 first kind of swing low on you move up
00:37:18.800 it's not really a swing well it is a
00:37:20.750 swing low right and then you would have
00:37:23.570 just adjusted it a little bit to make it
00:37:24.920 a little more clearer there and you
00:37:27.350 would have seen it comes up it comes up
00:37:28.820 it's kind of you know riding this
00:37:30.530 uptrend test right they're gonna reject
00:37:33.800 ninety percent of the time as its first
00:37:36.880 test no sorry first touch tries again
00:37:40.670 there as first test test doesn't quite
00:37:43.010 make it it's now getting kind of
00:37:45.500 squeezed into this point where if it
00:37:47.570 keeps moving sideways it's gonna move
00:37:48.920 down just like what we talked about
00:37:50.000 before so it actually has to break this
00:37:52.010 level pretty ferociously to kind of
00:37:53.540 continue writing this out right so you
00:37:55.400 can see it really gets pushed into this
00:37:58.070 corner here tries to break rejects and
00:38:02.440 right there kind of loses that loses its
00:38:06.260 trend and it should you know move down
00:38:08.180 pretty quick from here which which it
00:38:09.980 does right
00:38:12.970 so it moves down pretty quick right and
00:38:16.270 actually breaks that level right there
00:38:18.960 so yeah we don't need to go on any
00:38:22.060 further other than to see that this was
00:38:23.500 the trend right there now let's draw the
00:38:25.390 next trim just just for
00:38:28.750 whatever makes and matters if you want
00:38:32.079 to call it that for lack of using a
00:38:34.740 different term so then we have kind of
00:38:37.119 this other trend line here and let's get
00:38:39.460 out of the replayer now let's just catch
00:38:41.020 this stop yeah that's fine it doesn't
00:38:42.220 matter oh and look at that as soon as it
00:38:45.490 breaks it starts to move sideways and
00:38:46.780 now it's kind of in this channel here so
00:38:48.460 if we were to switch over to the daily
00:38:50.079 oh right we've got to turn it back on
00:38:52.690 first of course if we were to switch
00:38:55.030 over to the daily on this and we were to
00:38:57.490 flick that on and we were to like that
00:39:01.930 on on the daily and we were to flick
00:39:04.750 that on let's see what this shows us on
00:39:06.880 the daily is this gonna be congestion or
00:39:08.650 is this actually gonna be something of
00:39:11.170 relevance right swap over to the daily
00:39:14.200 let's clear this off of it and
00:39:19.690 doesn't show us anything is just
00:39:20.710 congestion is just confusion right so we
00:39:23.470 want to make sure that this time frame
00:39:28.800 time framing levels is is on the
00:39:31.180 appropriate spots right we don't want
00:39:32.950 when we go to our daily chart to see
00:39:34.480 what's going on we don't want to see 15
00:39:36.970 minutes straight lines like that it's
00:39:38.230 awkward let's go to our hourly chart see
00:39:40.180 how that looks the hourly chart it makes
00:39:42.940 sense on okay an hourly chart this is
00:39:47.050 going to make sense on
00:39:49.700 right you can see the hourly chart is
00:39:51.980 respecting it as well so when you switch
00:39:53.900 over to your hourly chart you you're
00:39:55.940 gonna have this visibility of what's
00:39:57.680 happening you're gonna say whoa look at
00:39:59.359 what's going on I've got a level that's
00:40:01.940 being tested right here right a level
00:40:03.890 that's not quite being tested up here
00:40:05.270 which is a weekly level I've got a
00:40:06.829 downtrend on the hourly that that kind
00:40:09.500 of got support off this level and
00:40:11.270 created an uptrend this uptrend came and
00:40:14.390 kind of squeezed between these two and
00:40:16.640 and failed and now it's moving down and
00:40:18.710 I know now that I'm moving sideways out
00:40:20.960 of this bleed right out of this
00:40:22.549 downtrend I'm moving sideways I can
00:40:24.260 establish my next move so on the hourly
00:40:25.819 it's still relevant right what about the
00:40:28.880 for our for our it's not relevant right
00:40:32.900 so on a 15-minute move what are we gonna
00:40:35.119 do and this is how I do it I think the
00:40:37.339 days off and I adjust this to 3 right 3
00:40:39.980 hours I don't want to go past 3 hours
00:40:41.660 when I'm yeah and I never use to our
00:40:44.119 chart I never use a 4-hour chart I'm
00:40:45.950 sorry I have two and a three hour chart
00:40:47.420 I very seldom we use a two hour chart
00:40:49.940 sometimes I will look at it it's it's
00:40:51.950 more for just kind of jokes but
00:40:53.710 sometimes I will look at it to our chart
00:40:55.790 but I'm using a 1 hour and a 4 hour
00:40:57.170 chart so I don't want this showing up
00:40:59.329 past the four hour mark I want this
00:41:04.040 showing up only from one hour to three
00:41:05.869 hours and you can even just put this to
00:41:07.760 one to one right just just keep it
00:41:09.530 simple
00:41:09.920 but you know as long as it doesn't show
00:41:11.660 up on the 4 hour I don't care I hate
00:41:13.040 that that's all I care about
00:41:14.450 so you want it to show up from 1 to 59
00:41:16.430 minutes one hour which is 60 minutes to
00:41:18.559 three hours ok so now we're gonna save
00:41:20.180 this we're gonna call this 15-minute
00:41:23.359 levels 15 Oh exclamation mark 5 15 min
00:41:28.520 level right ok so we are gonna save that
00:41:30.880 now when we sit over to the or for
00:41:33.349 hourly it is still there why is it still
00:41:35.390 there what's going on oh because I
00:41:38.599 didn't apply the template that's why of
00:41:40.819 course 15-minute level okay
00:41:45.520 fifteen minute level are you sure you
00:41:47.890 want to delete wait what did I do
00:41:49.450 no no I don't want to do that template
00:41:52.650 15-minute level okay that should be all
00:41:55.990 three oh I forgot one this one I thought
00:41:59.890 I did this one first as default
00:42:01.450 I guess not maybe I need to apply it
00:42:03.660 double-check them on here so we don't do
00:42:05.470 this again 15 yeah they're all one 15
00:42:07.780 minute level them so now when I go over
00:42:09.910 to my four level I don't have that
00:42:11.080 congestion so this gives me kind of
00:42:13.619 clarity to going through these charts
00:42:16.030 fast and snappy and I can I can chart
00:42:18.190 these out on different time frames
00:42:19.390 because something that's very important
00:42:21.640 that you guys have to know is bigger
00:42:26.230 moves right monthly moves are made up by
00:42:29.500 weekly moves and weekly moves are made
00:42:32.110 up by daily moves and daily moves are
00:42:34.210 made up by hourly moves in for 12 hour
00:42:37.060 and 4 hour and 1 hour and 15 minutes so
00:42:39.340 every time frame has an effect on its
00:42:43.770 earlier time brings and the earlier time
00:42:46.090 frames have an effect on the later time
00:42:47.680 frames of course it's kind of common
00:42:48.880 sense but it's very important to know
00:42:50.170 that all time frames effect each other
00:42:52.660 and you have to be charting these things
00:42:54.280 on multiple time frames to understand
00:42:56.050 what's going on
00:42:56.770 right so that is trends and that is
00:42:59.500 levels now this also applies to wedges
00:43:02.190 now if you guys remembered we we we made
00:43:07.930 this wedge right this this weekly wedge
00:43:10.119 we made this wedge purple for that
00:43:13.690 specific reason yesterday leading up
00:43:15.190 into this because we all who are we
00:43:16.630 already wanted to have this defined now
00:43:18.250 the daily and the sorry the weekly and
00:43:20.440 the monthly levels those are always on
00:43:23.740 on all charts because we need to know
00:43:25.600 that if we are in this period of time
00:43:29.280 this is getting a little wonky it keeps
00:43:31.660 you know which keeps switching over to
00:43:36.220 these time frames that just look like
00:43:38.080 spaghetti noodles and/or spaghetti
00:43:39.940 squash or some some kind of just weird
00:43:42.670 mash we need to know what's happening in
00:43:45.970 this moment so let's just pretend we are
00:43:48.369 right here in this move as we are moving
00:43:50.440 up we need to know that this weekly
00:43:53.140 level is approaching because that is
00:43:54.700 going to tell
00:43:55.670 the strength of the level and and and
00:43:57.770 how strong the offset of that is going
00:43:59.720 to be in if it's first touch or first
00:44:01.250 test and all these different things
00:44:02.540 right and we need to know that we are in
00:44:05.030 this wedge on the weekly level so if we
00:44:07.460 start to break out of this like what we
00:44:09.380 are doing here right if we are breaking
00:44:11.510 out of this wedge this is probably gonna
00:44:14.329 be a pretty big move down right I would
00:44:16.460 expect Manero well I wouldn't expect
00:44:20.900 anything yet because if I swap over to
00:44:22.579 the daily we're not actually broken out
00:44:24.530 of it yet we've we've just whipped out
00:44:25.940 just like we did here we've just kind of
00:44:27.829 whipped out of it so until I've seen you
00:44:30.050 know until I've seen the weekly clothes
00:44:31.670 outside of it I wouldn't expect anything
00:44:33.349 yet but I know is that I am starting to
00:44:37.339 test a break outside of this and if it
00:44:40.099 was say you know Sunday afternoon at
00:44:43.220 3:00 p.m. and we talked about this time
00:44:45.500 in the week a little bit on the last
00:44:47.630 lesson if it was Sunday at 3 p.m. in the
00:44:50.150 afternoon and I know the weekly is
00:44:51.410 closing soon this is something I need to
00:44:53.180 know you understand that if it's on a
00:44:56.750 Tuesday this has less relevance that on
00:45:00.410 a Sunday because maybe if it's Sunday at
00:45:02.540 3 p.m. in 4 hours and one more for our
00:45:06.049 candle I know we are going to be opening
00:45:08.000 up a new weekly outside of this so very
00:45:10.369 important to know so that's why we leave
00:45:12.619 the higher time frames on the higher
00:45:14.869 time frames are are left on because we
00:45:16.700 need to know what's going on in the move
00:45:18.049 and when we're coming up to this monthly
00:45:20.030 level here we need to know as we're
00:45:21.770 charting it but the lower stuff doesn't
00:45:23.809 matter on the higher end right and hope
00:45:25.940 that makes sense so now we are going to
00:45:29.270 apply the same concept with wedges so we
00:45:32.630 are gonna have different wedges and I
00:45:35.089 don't know let's just pick a spot here
00:45:37.160 that's the same thing happens with with
00:45:39.680 wedges so this is the low that started
00:45:42.079 to move up here we have a high there and
00:45:45.980 we have kind of this wedge here right so
00:45:47.720 we have kind of the same thing that
00:45:49.430 we've talked about in the past you know
00:45:50.930 an evolving wedge pattern that could you
00:45:54.260 know starts here and moves there so as
00:45:56.119 we go further into this wedge we'll talk
00:45:59.359 a little bit about just to kind of brush
00:46:01.880 up and refine more on the
00:46:03.920 you know why why just work and how they
00:46:05.420 do right we know right now that we are
00:46:08.780 in a larger wedge this purple one that's
00:46:10.250 all over the screen here we know that's
00:46:11.630 a larger a larger Valley or wedge
00:46:13.940 whichever one you want to call in a
00:46:15.200 larger Valley that's created over the
00:46:16.849 course of how many weeks ever we
00:46:18.559 identified it earlier so we can see that
00:46:21.650 the top side and this is all acting as
00:46:23.569 support resistance and as we break out
00:46:25.069 of this wedge right we can see that we
00:46:27.500 move up okay now in the moment this
00:46:30.500 would have been important because we
00:46:32.299 would have been right here whoops we
00:46:34.460 would have been right here right we
00:46:36.619 would have identified at
00:46:41.900 this point here and this point here
00:46:44.120 right we would have identified that's
00:46:47.150 the wedge and we would have basically
00:46:48.470 just lined it up with the bottom side of
00:46:49.850 this right at that point in time right
00:46:52.460 so we would have needed to see where
00:46:53.840 this is gonna go darn it let's go pack
00:47:04.090 whoopsies okay
00:47:06.920 wrong button okay okay so we would have
00:47:09.680 identified this wedge and we would have
00:47:11.510 kind of lined it up with the bottom side
00:47:12.800 of this trend and we already have it
00:47:14.240 lined up with the top side of this trend
00:47:15.620 so we would have kind of needed to see
00:47:16.820 where this is gonna go no hopefully yeah
00:47:18.110 you know 15 minute chart see kind of
00:47:22.880 goes down and it breaks the bottom side
00:47:24.230 of this breaks the bottom side of this
00:47:26.780 wedge so naturally it moves down so at
00:47:28.490 this point we would have then adjusted
00:47:30.140 it out to here right we would have it
00:47:31.580 then adjusted it like this we've got the
00:47:33.110 top side of this wedge and the bottom
00:47:34.370 side of the switch and on a 15-minute
00:47:36.650 chart now let's step forward a little
00:47:38.210 bit and it breaks out the top side of
00:47:41.180 that wedge right breaks out of the top
00:47:43.070 side and it creates a new pattern for us
00:47:45.290 right okay so right there we would have
00:47:48.590 seen that kind of a thing like this from
00:47:52.520 from there to there was that wedge there
00:47:54.770 and we know this is a swing low here
00:47:56.210 right so we would have just dragged this
00:47:58.280 out here right this top here to that top
00:48:00.650 there this bottom here to this bottom
00:48:02.510 here and we would have had this evolving
00:48:04.400 wedge
00:48:08.680 you can see it it respects it the whole
00:48:11.710 way and it lose actually looks like it's
00:48:14.230 losing those four this wedge here well
00:48:16.450 it's coming back in and it breaks down
00:48:17.890 out of the wedge so now it would have
00:48:19.870 evolved again and you know we could keep
00:48:21.700 going with this wedge we'll just you
00:48:24.760 know what we're gonna do is we're just
00:48:25.780 gonna swing this out to here
00:48:27.190 right so now this would have been like
00:48:28.810 this swing swing swing high swing swing
00:48:31.990 swing low let's see what happens this is
00:48:34.300 gonna be the last one I do cuz I don't
00:48:35.380 want to keep doing this right as it
00:48:37.060 breaks out of this wedge it starts to
00:48:38.410 move up now okay is this relevant on the
00:48:42.690 monthly and the let's get out of the
00:48:47.320 replay er yes is this relevant on a
00:48:50.170 weekly chart let's take a look what does
00:48:53.560 this tell us on a weekly chart
00:48:56.900 oh I already have it turned off
00:49:02.170 I can see set this back to default why
00:49:05.769 is this off let's set this one as I
00:49:10.059 apply defaults right and let's turn it
00:49:14.200 yellow I think it was because I was
00:49:15.970 playing with them this is this is from
00:49:17.440 my main profile and let's turn the
00:49:19.630 opacity down on this so we can actually
00:49:21.039 see what's going on and then we are
00:49:22.569 going to go back again and we are going
00:49:25.210 to change the outline color to the thick
00:49:26.829 yellow color and we are going to turn
00:49:28.119 that down so that's a little too little
00:49:29.950 too bright Oh yellow and
00:49:31.760 [Music]
00:49:33.750 a little border just uh very subtle okay
00:49:38.940 so now let's switch over to our monthly
00:49:47.730 you might not see it cuz I think it's
00:49:49.800 hidden by a candle let's switch over to
00:49:51.180 our weekly like what does that tell us
00:49:53.490 it shows us literally nothing like this
00:49:56.400 is just useless congestion on the on the
00:49:59.280 chart it doesn't show you anything right
00:50:00.930 it just shows you just blot my know how
00:50:04.290 it's to say it let's go to the daily is
00:50:06.150 it more blonde the daily probably right
00:50:08.700 yeah like what is that showing us
00:50:10.260 nothing it's just like a fancy design
00:50:12.390 well it's not here it's it's definitely
00:50:14.520 not fancy that's not a fancy just hide
00:50:16.200 it's just that just a shape on the
00:50:18.000 screen there's a random shape that has
00:50:19.920 no relevance whatsoever on a 4-hour
00:50:22.650 chart does this have any relevance at
00:50:24.630 all not really very very little what
00:50:27.540 could you have told but like what could
00:50:29.040 you really have seen based on this that
00:50:30.510 you would have seen somewhere like this
00:50:31.590 is not right what could have shown you
00:50:35.100 on the hourly let's take a look on the
00:50:37.980 hourly it is showing you more
00:50:39.660 information right it is showing you more
00:50:42.060 information on the hourly so this is
00:50:43.470 this is another example of something
00:50:45.270 where we are gonna go into it and we are
00:50:47.250 going to double click it right to set
00:50:49.380 the parameters and we are going to turn
00:50:51.450 off the days weeks months and we are
00:50:54.000 gonna go template we have one hour to 24
00:50:56.760 no we don't want 24 we're just gonna go
00:50:58.080 3 max we are going to go template save
00:51:01.260 as 15 men
00:51:03.690 wedge right so now we have a 15 minute
00:51:06.180 wedge identified we have 15 minute trend
00:51:08.130 lines you know as we search for the four
00:51:10.590 hour those are gone
00:51:11.640 right no more congestion voila boom
00:51:14.820 we've got a beautiful chart now we can
00:51:17.010 now snap through these quickly we can we
00:51:20.100 can switch to see what's going on on a
00:51:21.390 15 minute to the hourly to the 4-hour to
00:51:24.120 the daily to the weekly to the monthly
00:51:25.500 and we have great clarity and we are
00:51:27.570 able to see these charts now with with a
00:51:30.930 better understanding of what's actually
00:51:32.160 happening in perspective to what chart
00:51:36.510 we are on if we were on a monthly we
00:51:37.980 don't want to see that daily stuff it it
00:51:39.690 makes no difference it has no relevance
00:51:41.250 like you've seen right so that's part of
00:51:43.740 that that kind of that idea of
00:51:45.890 segregation of time frames as well right
00:51:49.320 there's a few different layers of that
00:51:51.450 segregation there is the support and
00:51:54.420 resistance which is monthly and weekly
00:51:57.000 is your top bracket and then daily down
00:52:00.720 is your
00:52:01.290 your second sector your second bracket
00:52:02.970 right which we went over there is then
00:52:05.340 the patterns and trends and daily levels
00:52:08.940 so then daily levels end up or being
00:52:11.430 reflected to everything back right and
00:52:14.400 weekly levels get reflected everything
00:52:16.860 above okay so we have that idea of daily
00:52:21.840 down now going to the exact opposite end
00:52:24.510 we have 15 minutes right 15 minute is
00:52:27.540 only good to 15 minute to an hour right
00:52:29.670 this is more of a short-term trade right
00:52:33.150 you you're gonna use this for you know
00:52:35.010 retracement trades or or different
00:52:37.190 Trinity to fall within you know a six
00:52:39.420 hour time frame or maybe even a daily
00:52:40.920 timeframe right and then we have the
00:52:43.830 four hour so let's go over this real
00:52:45.750 quick okay so for our what are we gonna
00:52:50.310 color a four-hour wedge let's just do
00:52:53.340 let's do green but like a spring green
00:52:55.050 that'll be kind of cool so for our
00:53:02.560 we have here we have this here by the
00:53:05.860 looks of it
00:53:06.490 okay so let's actually mark this up rock
00:53:08.740 let me zoom in so I can actually see
00:53:10.120 what's going on here and not just kind
00:53:11.710 of eyeball it we have the
00:53:16.660 top of the move that started the
00:53:18.730 downtrend right so that's right there to
00:53:21.850 here and I just colored the border
00:53:24.040 differently let's color the whole thing
00:53:25.600 differently that doesn't work very well
00:53:27.430 at all
00:53:28.030 a little darker maybe yeah okay but that
00:53:31.750 works so we have the move that started
00:53:37.210 it down we have this here to that swing
00:53:39.400 low there we then have so we have swing
00:53:43.840 low here we're gonna drag that oh and
00:53:45.730 then we have high to this high here
00:53:47.860 right high it would have first started
00:53:50.320 here like this right so I right there to
00:53:57.670 the swing low to the swing high and it
00:53:59.410 would have broken out before it moved
00:54:01.000 down and looks like it gained something
00:54:02.710 you know I found support off this level
00:54:04.210 and move back into this wedge and broke
00:54:06.460 up so at that point it would have been
00:54:07.930 like this right this swing low here
00:54:11.110 right and that swing high there and it
00:54:16.600 moved up so as this goes we are just
00:54:19.360 going to keep evolving this out okay so
00:54:22.240 now we are at this swing low here which
00:54:25.930 ends up being the same trend here so if
00:54:27.640 you drew a trendline you would have
00:54:28.750 actually had you know the trend line
00:54:33.250 from here to here at this point at this
00:54:34.510 point acting as support resistance the
00:54:37.000 whole way through right kind of I don't
00:54:41.290 have my magnet tool on so everything is
00:54:42.610 getting a little misaligned here come on
00:54:49.240 there we go something like that okay so
00:54:51.339 I'm just gonna delete that for now
00:54:52.869 anyways to show you you know where that
00:54:54.430 line would have come in and we can now
00:54:56.650 see that we have a different time frame
00:55:00.240 what that's that's important for us to
00:55:02.710 know right so now we are working within
00:55:04.780 this for our wedge and let's take a look
00:55:06.760 at that of course we already know the
00:55:08.440 answer to this on the month it's not
00:55:09.520 going to be relevant we're you know
00:55:10.660 you're not even gonna see it because
00:55:11.680 it's you know hidden in here what about
00:55:13.869 the weekly is again you're not even
00:55:15.730 gonna see it it's hidden in there daily
00:55:19.480 oh maybe it's turned off actually I
00:55:21.869 could have this turned off from my
00:55:23.800 template too okay this is what's going
00:55:28.960 on with this one
00:55:29.760 we have this as a 15-minute wedge okay
00:55:33.160 so this one we are going to save as and
00:55:36.579 we want want this to show on the
00:55:40.990 one-hour to four hour and the one day as
00:55:44.470 well just one day we are gonna save this
00:55:49.150 one as for our wedge so anytime we have
00:55:53.109 a four hour wedge we're creating we can
00:55:54.609 come and and use this like this right
00:55:56.799 and we can go ahead and just quickly
00:56:00.160 click that template and apply it it's
00:56:01.720 just a matter of double-clicking it
00:56:02.890 going here I have a 15 minute wedge and
00:56:05.140 I have for our wedge so now I'm just
00:56:06.220 gonna go for our wedge okay bang so
00:56:08.680 let's now go back and take a look at
00:56:10.270 this you won't even see it on the weekly
00:56:11.799 on the daily it's actually relevant on
00:56:14.470 the daily and that's why I ticked it off
00:56:15.760 on the daily because this is where on
00:56:17.920 the daily you are gonna see the
00:56:19.660 relevance of this and you kind of have a
00:56:21.670 wedge within a wedge here one wedge kind
00:56:24.400 of breaking out of a wedge you know but
00:56:27.970 let's think about that for a second we
00:56:29.349 have for our wedge breaking a weekly
00:56:30.819 wedge for our wedge is not breaking a
00:56:32.950 weekly wedge it's just showing us what's
00:56:34.480 happening in the move because the weekly
00:56:36.010 might not be over right this is not over
00:56:38.589 yet this is still within the confines of
00:56:41.290 our valley so it's actually not over yet
00:56:44.410 okay so let's go back to the four hour
00:56:48.400 we've identified this on a four hour and
00:56:50.460 we can see that it is important on this
00:56:53.290 four hour chart okay now let's go to the
00:56:55.510 one hour what do we have on our one hour
00:56:58.059 chart
00:57:00.710 we gotta rewind this if not rewind it
00:57:02.600 but I guess expanded back a bit a little
00:57:06.560 bit of magic here so now we can see we
00:57:10.010 have right we have our larger for our
00:57:12.530 wedge that's living inside our weekly
00:57:14.780 wedge they have a four hour which a
00:57:15.980 weekly wedge and then we have some of
00:57:17.720 these levels here now let's expand this
00:57:19.390 further okay we're gonna expand this
00:57:23.180 further and we can see we have this
00:57:25.730 15-minute wedge that's showing us maybe
00:57:27.380 a 15-minute move that's relevant to our
00:57:30.230 hourly right and this would have
00:57:31.460 continued to expand out right and this
00:57:33.290 would have you know ended up being like
00:57:35.660 that and then you know this is what I'm
00:57:38.390 ended up being something like that until
00:57:39.890 it ends up actually being you know
00:57:42.380 another wedge within a wedge right so
00:57:44.570 what ended up being something like that
00:57:46.100 and as that broke this 15-minute trend
00:57:49.010 right so we were looking at the
00:57:50.600 15-minute wedge and we're just kind of
00:57:53.830 quickly well okay let's leave that where
00:57:56.390 it was because we already identified the
00:57:58.040 bottom and let's do this properly let's
00:57:59.990 line up this swing low to this swing low
00:58:01.880 here right this is gonna we're gonna do
00:58:04.130 this properly we're not gonna just shock
00:58:05.330 on this like I'm trying to do it okay so
00:58:07.480 swing low on the on the 15-minute swing
00:58:10.940 high comes down this would have been the
00:58:12.620 first swing low right it would have done
00:58:14.480 something nice from that mega cool off
00:58:16.220 that's super frustrating right it would
00:58:17.870 have done something like this it lost
00:58:19.100 that it came down create a new swing
00:58:20.510 well right we already know that's the
00:58:21.800 swing high and this swing high is
00:58:23.690 actually living within this for our
00:58:24.980 swing high so now you can see both are
00:58:26.840 pretty big levels there so now we have
00:58:30.380 this fifteen minute down right here
00:58:32.870 right it comes up it's a downtrend comes
00:58:37.190 as it comes out of this downtrend here
00:58:39.950 move sideways back up into this
00:58:41.990 let's continuously move this out right
00:58:44.960 and at this point this wedge would have
00:58:46.910 been almost obsolete right this is
00:58:49.790 getting too big right it's a 15 minute
00:58:52.730 wedge that's not this is more of trend
00:58:54.530 lines that's happening now so we lose
00:58:56.630 this 15 minute wedge right here right
00:58:59.180 you can see that as we break some of
00:59:01.040 these levels here so let's walk through
00:59:02.540 this a little bit and this is why this
00:59:04.040 is important okay you've got this bounce
00:59:07.280 off the bottom of the wedge here you
00:59:09.080 come up test the level test a level
00:59:11.300 reject once you start moving sideways
00:59:13.700 because we
00:59:14.240 created this uptrend like that we
00:59:16.010 created this uptrend this trend line up
00:59:18.590 once you move sideways you are losing
00:59:20.930 that trend line that 15-minute trend
00:59:23.420 line you are losing that trend line and
00:59:25.850 moving down right that is now resistant
00:59:28.130 so you've lost that trend line and this
00:59:30.050 in itself now okay
00:59:34.950 silly green marks on my screen now let's
00:59:39.720 do something else here what does this
00:59:40.619 look like
00:59:43.700 this looks like another Valley right so
00:59:46.250 you can see how tram lines create
00:59:47.660 valleys within valleys and time frame is
00:59:49.520 important so this is another valley as
00:59:50.990 we reject off of this right here off of
00:59:54.680 this level as we reject and we break
00:59:56.329 that Valley well what happens when we
00:59:57.950 break a valley we're gonna move down
00:59:59.299 right we're losing that and we had aa
01:00:00.950 resistance here and we have resistance
01:00:02.480 on this trend line or this valley line
01:00:05.180 so we moved down outside of our
01:00:08.559 15-minute wedge right this was our
01:00:11.240 15-minute wedge you see that and look
01:00:14.569 what we do we test our for our wedge
01:00:16.549 right we take this bleed down and we
01:00:19.250 start moving sideways to test the for
01:00:20.900 our wedge so now right as we get rid of
01:00:25.460 few these this came pretty ridiculous as
01:00:28.640 we now bounce off this we know we need
01:00:32.059 to break this and this is going to act
01:00:34.220 as a resistance on a 15-minute chart so
01:00:36.799 you can see how having these different
01:00:40.010 time frames of clarity make a great
01:00:42.109 impact to the way you trade and they are
01:00:43.670 going to give you a certain amount of
01:00:48.130 reactions and and and speed and clarity
01:00:50.809 because like I said this stuff it's it's
01:00:53.900 not relevant right it's not relevant on
01:00:56.990 a daily chart this I don't need to know
01:00:58.730 this like this is not
01:01:00.079 oops all that stuff that happens in that
01:01:03.829 four hour chart on the 15 minute I I
01:01:05.480 don't need to know that right I need to
01:01:07.730 know this on a one-day chart and that's
01:01:09.260 it like this one right here what was
01:01:11.000 this one this was like a 15 minute wedge
01:01:12.770 and I never set this one this is the one
01:01:14.180 I didn't set right when I just kind of
01:01:15.770 quickly created this wedge so let's
01:01:19.569 double click this and we would have
01:01:21.500 created this based on a 15 minute wedge
01:01:23.290 let's create that 15-minute wedge there
01:01:25.670 and you know now it's gone we don't need
01:01:28.160 to know that wedge is there so you guys
01:01:29.900 can see how as you're flicking through
01:01:31.790 these levels now we've started to build
01:01:34.369 out and create almost this army of
01:01:37.520 wedges and trends and we can see exactly
01:01:39.740 what's going on in these moves right and
01:01:41.299 you can see that if I'm looking at my
01:01:43.869 weekly chart I don't need to see any of
01:01:46.790 that other stuff it's not important it's
01:01:48.799 it's and and it keeps your mind clear
01:01:50.540 and it keeps your eye on the prize and
01:01:52.099 it keeps you able to adapt quickly and
01:01:55.609 make this
01:01:56.079 because when you're charting the last
01:01:57.609 thing you want to do is spend eight
01:02:00.339 hours on every chart you want to really
01:02:02.199 pin down and nail your charts right do
01:02:05.650 them properly pin them down and nail
01:02:07.209 them put templates on them start
01:02:09.400 adjusting time frame so you can move
01:02:10.900 through these things quickly that way if
01:02:12.999 you're getting into a scalp trade you
01:02:14.349 already know what's going on right
01:02:15.699 you already know oh look right here
01:02:17.199 there's a perfect spot for a short right
01:02:20.519 look at this we're rejecting this level
01:02:25.080 things love a perfect spot for a short
01:02:26.610 we're gonna break out of this wedge
01:02:27.720 which is gonna break the next 15-minute
01:02:29.220 wedge we create this trend here we know
01:02:31.050 that we're gonna get caught somewhere on
01:02:32.670 the 4:00 hour because the 15 minutes not
01:02:34.200 gonna break a four hour or at least it's
01:02:35.640 gonna bounce once it's gonna bounce
01:02:37.170 again and then maybe it'll you know hit
01:02:38.850 here and then bounce back up at all
01:02:40.230 it'll touch this daily level and then
01:02:41.940 it'll come up and maybe test this to try
01:02:43.530 to come back in it maybe it won't it
01:02:44.910 will come and it'll settle down here but
01:02:46.740 by having this stuff templated out you
01:02:49.590 can see that the opportunity for a swing
01:02:52.350 trade here was fantastic
01:02:54.360 because you can see right here this
01:02:55.980 level is being rejected and we are being
01:02:57.810 forced out of a 15-minute wedge and we
01:02:59.280 when we lose this 15-minute wide we're
01:03:00.810 going down we then create trend and
01:03:02.960 wallah so is a story so you can see how
01:03:08.150 well to start why we couldn't go over
01:03:11.070 all of this in one video which was the
01:03:12.990 last video because it becomes quite
01:03:15.060 elaborate and that level adaptation and
01:03:17.520 how to move through levels a little
01:03:19.380 differently more a more evolved version
01:03:22.280 adapting timeframes in a few different
01:03:25.470 ways adapting timeframes based on the
01:03:27.540 way we indicate daily levels right and
01:03:30.570 based on time frames away we indicate
01:03:32.820 sort of daily levels of support and
01:03:34.560 resistance and the time framing levels
01:03:37.710 right going back to this
01:03:40.780 thing right here which is time framing
01:03:43.630 levels so that's a pretty big piece of
01:03:48.450 what level adaptation is and how and
01:03:51.370 your guys first taste of how to adapt
01:03:53.080 your levels and and be processed that we
01:03:55.540 will take these theories of what we are
01:03:57.160 learning and we will start to implement
01:03:59.650 them into levels this has been a long
01:04:02.230 video full of context you probably guys
01:04:04.540 are probably gonna have to watch it a
01:04:06.850 few times this was a this was a doozy
01:04:08.820 the assessment of time framing is kind
01:04:11.440 of what we went over in the end
01:04:15.750 wowsers
01:04:16.960 that was a good a good lesson the most
01:04:20.440 important one by far in the beginners
01:04:22.480 course we are coming close to the end of
01:04:24.880 this beginners course and and this was
01:04:26.530 by far the most important one because it
01:04:28.300 gave you guys an insight as to putting
01:04:30.070 all of these theories together to kind
01:04:31.750 of create a chart and build out your
01:04:34.300 first professional level chart where you
01:04:37.870 can see what's going on and you can you
01:04:39.700 can now at this point should be able to
01:04:42.040 take all the things we learned in the
01:04:43.420 first eight lessons and put them all
01:04:46.000 together into this idea of adaptation of
01:04:49.360 levels right remember levels are not
01:04:51.250 just support and resistant well not just
01:04:53.430 swing lows and high levels right support
01:04:56.050 resistance levels but also wedges
01:04:57.580 patterns valleys trends levels abroad
01:05:00.250 right and how you guys can now see
01:05:03.570 volume and momentum offsetting against
01:05:06.190 certain levels with the idea of trends
01:05:08.920 it kind of taking all these and now
01:05:10.870 putting them into one final kind of
01:05:13.090 melting pot of amazingness so what is
01:05:17.140 level adaptation we went through that
01:05:18.610 just now level segregation again did the
01:05:22.300 two sectors that levels live in either
01:05:24.280 box a or box be based on it you know box
01:05:28.120 a or box there there we go box B so I
01:05:30.550 have to look at my camera to - or sorry
01:05:33.640 my screen to see where my hands are
01:05:36.040 make sure they're not off-screen so the
01:05:39.280 the different ways that these live in
01:05:41.410 different sectors time framing levels
01:05:45.010 and how different time frames and making
01:05:48.070 these templates
01:05:49.560 kind of play into the overall scheme of
01:05:51.720 things and how you can do that on your
01:05:53.190 own and the assessment of time framing
01:05:55.680 and what it means and the theory behind
01:05:57.390 it and how it affects our charts in
01:05:59.640 total so this has been been a great
01:06:02.760 lesson it ties together a lot of things
01:06:04.890 we talked about again if you guys
01:06:09.360 haven't liked and subscribed to the

00:00:18.320 would recommend you do so as I post up
00:00:19.939 my trades their content release and kind
00:00:22.009 of what I'm doing on a day to day basis
00:00:23.419 okay let's get right to it
00:00:25.399 alright I want to take a few minutes to
00:00:28.309 just discuss what's next with this
00:00:29.660 channel as this is the wrapping up of
00:00:31.880 the beginners course this will be the
00:00:33.860 final lesson in the beginners course so
00:00:37.420 what's next
00:00:38.900 before we talk about that I want to
00:00:41.000 break down these three things f80 anma
00:00:43.430 there's three types of analysis in our
00:00:45.470 markets there's fundamental analysis and
00:00:47.329 that's the study of companies in crypto
00:00:51.980 space they're the white papers they're
00:00:53.720 the company ethos it's basically the
00:00:57.130 beliefs of the company and if you are an
00:00:59.690 investor of that company the technical
00:01:02.420 analysis now technical analysis only
00:01:05.059 really got popularized in the 80s before
00:01:07.820 that it was kind of laughed at like wow
00:01:10.550 fundamental analysis is what we trade
00:01:12.979 and invest based on and not up until the
00:01:15.380 80s was technical analysis actually used
00:01:18.320 in the markets as kind of the science
00:01:20.690 and the why of trading call them
00:01:23.479 technicians palm in turn right you chart
00:01:27.409 you're doing technical analysis you're a
00:01:28.909 technician know how good of a technician
00:01:30.680 you are that's that's your
00:01:32.360 responsibility in your duty right and
00:01:33.920 mental analysis mental analysis is the
00:01:38.320 training of the discipline of the mind
00:01:40.760 the the things that the psychology
00:01:43.220 behind trading it's the things like
00:01:45.710 bankroll management it's a things like
00:01:47.270 the ability to to move past bad trades
00:01:52.610 or or see through good trades it's it's
00:01:54.770 the analysis of the psyche and the
00:01:57.049 mental side of trading
00:02:00.119 now something I want to talk about about
00:02:02.430 technical analysis briefly is technical
00:02:05.159 analysis because it's only been around
00:02:06.390 since the 80s it is still an evolving
00:02:09.199 form it is still an evolving art it is
00:02:12.540 not something that we have seen the
00:02:14.130 final form of yet we probably won't see
00:02:16.709 the final form for a long time and it is
00:02:18.690 still right now being explored and
00:02:21.510 discovered and and the things from the
00:02:23.280 past you know they have like 10 or
00:02:25.980 15-year like period where the things
00:02:28.200 that were once invented in the 80s were
00:02:30.720 used till the 90s and then the things
00:02:32.910 that we're using the 90s were used to
00:02:34.170 the 2000s and it's kind of this constant
00:02:36.000 evolving Reformation and recreation of
00:02:39.720 technical analysis and it gets more and
00:02:41.220 more advanced over time so something
00:02:42.989 important to know is that you will never
00:02:45.000 learn the final version of technical
00:02:46.830 analysis it is something that is always
00:02:48.870 evolving it is something that will never
00:02:51.870 stop right and and with a breed of new
00:02:54.390 markets like cryptocurrencies we are
00:02:56.489 seeing already some some resolutions of
00:03:00.200 the technical analysis that we have out
00:03:02.849 there right now and even even in what
00:03:05.190 I'll teach you guys in in the Advanced
00:03:06.840 Course I am now starting to see where
00:03:10.560 technical analysis is going and what's
00:03:12.510 morphing into next right it's a part of
00:03:14.700 being a really good trader is being able
00:03:16.739 to stay ahead of the curve and being
00:03:18.239 able to spot these things don't get too
00:03:23.100 wrapped up in the evolution of technical
00:03:25.140 analysis though because it's something
00:03:26.370 that takes years to develop so but take
00:03:29.340 away from that is don't get stuck in one
00:03:31.290 place thinking that you know everything
00:03:34.769 there is to always know always educate
00:03:36.780 yourself and do your due diligence to
00:03:40.130 continuously grow as a trader but but
00:03:43.109 don't don't go to the extreme other side
00:03:44.819 to where you're starting to grasp at
00:03:46.739 straws and create these theories that
00:03:48.150 don't exist because you won't you you
00:03:51.660 you you'll you'll get into the black
00:03:53.190 hole right you'll get into the the
00:03:54.780 mental analysis and the black hole of
00:03:56.160 training that is trying to always chase
00:03:58.109 something it's the same thing I tell
00:03:59.880 people while using indicators don't fall
00:04:01.500 into the black hole of using indicators
00:04:02.670 because you'll use one it'll fail you
00:04:04.470 use another that one will fail and and
00:04:06.870 you get sucked into the black hole the
00:04:08.340 same thing can happen with the technical
00:04:09.629 analysis don't overthink it practice
00:04:11.909 what you know
00:04:13.200 perfect what you're learning and move on
00:04:15.540 okay
00:04:17.220 so what's next for the course after that
00:04:19.620 little rant about the three different
00:04:20.579 types of things and the reason I ranted
00:04:22.950 about that is because I will be breaking
00:04:24.450 down the technical analysis in multiple
00:04:27.510 courses right we have the beginners
00:04:28.650 course we have the Advanced Course and
00:04:30.600 I'm considering to do a professional
00:04:31.560 level course as well so something above
00:04:34.200 advanced which I haven't decided if I'm
00:04:35.940 gonna do yet but beyond that I'm gonna
00:04:37.919 be doing mental analysis I'm gonna have
00:04:39.360 a whole entire course as well outside of
00:04:41.639 technical analysis on mental analysis so
00:04:45.260 it's something to look forward to in the
00:04:47.160 future one of the pillars of training is
00:04:49.110 MA and yeah I think it would be great
00:04:51.960 value to people and then looking at
00:04:54.810 possible live streams and morning
00:04:56.910 uploads or morning uploads one of the
00:04:58.860 other obviously not both but possibly
00:05:01.530 opening up a live stream to kind of log
00:05:06.090 on every morning have a place where
00:05:08.040 people can all come to and and see
00:05:10.169 what's going on for the day and watch me
00:05:11.940 trade and do what I do you know whether
00:05:14.490 you guys want to follow in the same
00:05:15.510 trades or do your own trades or you're
00:05:16.950 just there to hang out it doesn't matter
00:05:18.090 you know everybody's welcome so I'm
00:05:20.130 considering a couple different avenues
00:05:21.840 of where this goes from here just
00:05:24.660 because the support has been so great
00:05:26.010 and people love the course and and it's
00:05:28.770 helping a lot of you guys out there for
00:05:31.110 from what we've learned so far it's it's
00:05:32.760 helping you guys a ton and I'm getting
00:05:34.350 amazing feedback and people are
00:05:36.180 supporting me in great ways so looking
00:05:39.270 at maybe possibly doing either a live
00:05:40.710 stream or morning uploads or maybe
00:05:42.570 nothing maybe I just leave it at a
00:05:43.710 course and and I and I give you guys
00:05:45.750 this material you know give to the
00:05:47.940 people and and I leave it at that and I
00:05:50.640 just stop and and and that becomes it
00:05:53.340 there becomes nothing after that I'm not
00:05:54.690 sure I haven't defined the future of
00:05:57.030 this thing yet but these are the things
00:05:58.770 I'm considering right now so if you if
00:06:00.030 you have an opinion voice that tell me
00:06:01.380 what you want to see from this channel
00:06:02.940 as it grows yeah all right wrapping up
00:06:09.479 the course
00:06:11.689 you
00:06:14.480 I want you guys to get one very specific
00:06:18.260 takeaway from this thing and the
00:06:20.600 takeaway is that what I'm teaching you
00:06:23.570 here
00:06:25.630 is going to evolve with the advanced
00:06:28.060 course what I've taught in the beginners
00:06:30.910 course is the groundwork to the constant
00:06:33.880 refinement of these skills okay so I
00:06:38.770 want to go over something regarding this
00:06:41.440 course I need you guys to know that the
00:06:44.110 technical analysis that I teach in the
00:06:45.850 beginners course is not the final form
00:06:48.100 of technical analysis so what I mean by
00:06:52.180 that he is what I'm teaching right now
00:06:53.710 is very specific to start training your
00:06:55.690 eye for the more advanced material
00:06:57.900 everything evolves just like in lesson I
00:07:00.910 believe it was nine level adaptation no
00:07:03.730 that would have been eight or not it
00:07:06.730 doesn't matter whether it was less than
00:07:08.170 eight or less than nine that the whole
00:07:09.730 level adaptation lesson was all about
00:07:11.800 taking what we knew and evolving it to
00:07:14.440 the next step right it takes years and
00:07:18.760 years and years to perfect this stuff
00:07:20.310 there's not one video I can show you
00:07:22.960 guys that shows you the the total
00:07:25.810 confines of that one lesson so so wedges
00:07:29.490 levels trends patterns these are all
00:07:32.470 pieces that I've given you in the
00:07:33.910 beginners course that we will be
00:07:35.740 building upon in the future courses
00:07:37.510 right well bewell be taking what we know
00:07:39.610 and we'll be evolving and adapting it to
00:07:41.590 a different set of constraints so know
00:07:46.150 that what you're learning isn't the
00:07:47.470 final form it is important to understand
00:07:50.020 that
00:07:50.830 baby steps have to be taken you have to
00:07:52.900 learn certain procedures and processes
00:07:53.920 first before you can see the reasons why
00:07:58.240 we do some of the things we do right so
00:07:59.980 as we go on we'll be refining everything
00:08:02.020 that we we know from this point on and
00:08:04.080 but but not to the point where it makes
00:08:06.190 it you know unusable to the point where
00:08:09.400 were just elevating it to the next level
00:08:11.320 right it was it was the intent of this
00:08:13.570 course from the beginning was to teach
00:08:14.950 you the baby steps so that we could go
00:08:17.230 into this is why we learned it this way
00:08:19.180 so we can apply it in this way okay so
00:08:22.360 let's just get into a live trade I think
00:08:25.330 that wraps up a little bit of everything
00:08:27.400 the oversight of the course the kind of
00:08:29.590 the goodbye to the beginners course part
00:08:31.750 one and/or the beginners course live
00:08:34.330 trade part one video and yeah let's get
00:08:36.610 right into it
00:08:38.190 so MDA has been a coin that I've been
00:08:41.919 asked by a few people to charge just
00:08:43.780 because it's had such big price swings
00:08:47.380 and MDA is my way to loyalty points for
00:08:49.930 those of you don't know it's been a very
00:08:51.580 popular coin lately there's been a lot
00:08:55.420 of price action on it and it has had
00:08:57.850 some pretty big swings so I've been
00:09:00.070 asked to chart this and I you know buy
00:09:03.390 an audience member a student and I said
00:09:06.190 sure why not I need a coin to charge
00:09:07.810 anyway so why don't I check this one so
00:09:10.660 if I was setting up a live trade on my
00:09:13.420 way to make I'm saying that right my
00:09:15.700 waiter yeah MD or just call an MD by the
00:09:17.440 ticker what would I do
00:09:18.910 okay so
00:09:19.440 so this is how I'm starting every trade
00:09:20.790 I'm starting every trade by looking at
00:09:23.790 the let me just drag this window down a
00:09:26.399 bit here I'm starting every trade by
00:09:28.740 looking at the monthly right I'm gonna
00:09:31.560 mark out my monthly levels and I'm using
00:09:33.569 silver for my monthly levels make sure
00:09:34.860 my magnet tool is on so a very first
00:09:36.810 thing I want to do is you know look at
00:09:39.089 the swing low of this move and the high
00:09:41.610 of that candle right so swing low the
00:09:44.430 high of that candle and then the swing
00:09:46.290 high
00:09:48.590 and these swing well that candle so I've
00:09:51.320 just defined some monthly levels and you
00:09:53.779 know for four simple lines to start this
00:09:56.029 chart to understand the kind of the
00:09:58.130 highest level strength of level in this
00:10:00.110 coin and this is on Finance right now
00:10:02.210 we're on the one month on Finance I'll
00:10:04.730 try to keep this in the middle of the
00:10:05.839 screen as best I can so my camera is not
00:10:07.370 in the way so as we can see you know we
00:10:11.060 have a swing low swing high of that move
00:10:14.210 we we then have the high of the move and
00:10:16.940 the swing low of the high so so we we
00:10:19.160 kind of have the initial bounding boxes
00:10:22.640 if you are the initial containment zones
00:10:25.279 or or you know however you want to refer
00:10:26.990 to them as is so that's how I would
00:10:28.970 start this chart then I would go to the
00:10:30.230 weekly and you know I break this down
00:10:32.480 even further and
00:10:33.900 [Music]
00:10:36.060 let's change my color to my week the
00:10:38.550 color which is purple so I'm gonna look
00:10:40.290 at this you know comes down I have a
00:10:43.650 monthly level to find there that's fine
00:10:45.920 swing hi here let's let's mark the swing
00:10:48.720 high at the low candle and you notice
00:10:50.760 right away that's actually the monthly
00:10:51.930 level and and that's probably why that
00:10:53.490 monthly bubble was created so we can
00:10:54.840 actually take this away but just to
00:10:56.010 drive this point home you know if we
00:10:58.740 were here in the move right if we were
00:11:05.220 right here in the move it's being a
00:11:07.500 little funny let me reload this chart
00:11:11.330 any of these being a little funny for me
00:11:12.890 right now wonder if this will work now
00:11:15.320 let's go to the weekly
00:11:22.010 and let's remark that love-a-lot rate
00:11:24.140 here Hey now let's hopefully this replay
00:11:26.930 it'll work yeah there we go and we
00:11:30.230 need to change us to purple because that
00:11:31.760 was our weekly level so so if we were
00:11:33.350 marking this out and even though we were
00:11:35.120 we're on the weekly chart here and we
00:11:36.320 can kind of see that this weekly
00:11:38.270 develops a swing low right there you
00:11:41.090 know we know that
00:11:43.470 this is a level for the future so as we
00:11:47.550 come up here
00:11:48.420 not sure why it's running through this
00:11:50.970 on the daily but that's okay ken ran
00:11:52.350 through on the daily that's fine you can
00:11:54.900 see we touch up here and we create our
00:11:56.160 swing high and then we're obviously
00:11:57.960 gonna come down and respect that level
00:12:01.080 right there so you can see right there
00:12:02.280 as we go through the chart that's that's
00:12:04.410 a level that was respected this kind of
00:12:08.840 without a few times and that that's
00:12:10.680 enough for this we don't need this
00:12:11.700 anymore so you can see you know in the
00:12:14.790 moment why that would have happened that
00:12:16.050 that would be the level that would have
00:12:17.280 been respected anyways we can delete
00:12:18.660 that because it's not important because
00:12:19.980 we have a stronger level which is our
00:12:21.210 monthly level go through this move with
00:12:25.950 weekly levels okay so we have the swing
00:12:28.230 high swing low this is a test of that
00:12:29.880 monthly we don't need that this is not a
00:12:32.400 level here because this is the that this
00:12:34.740 is not you know it might look like a
00:12:36.270 level but it's not that's not a level
00:12:39.680 let's go swing low is just testing this
00:12:42.390 swing I was testing this here now this
00:12:49.720 now that wouldn't be a level either so
00:12:52.509 really we don't have any weekly levels
00:12:54.279 because they're all they're all
00:12:55.290 respecting the confines of this monthly
00:12:58.509 chart actually so we actually don't have
00:13:00.250 any weekly levels and I just want to
00:13:01.629 make sure that we do have one swing low
00:13:04.420 here so we are gonna add that let's use
00:13:05.949 a magnet tool get get exact the swing
00:13:08.319 high of this move is at a level either
00:13:09.490 and okay we have one swing high weekly
00:13:11.439 here so let's let's mark out these two
00:13:13.209 levels so those are two levels right
00:13:15.670 there that's it we actually don't have
00:13:19.899 any other week than level so you can see
00:13:21.250 that even just marking out the initial
00:13:22.529 monthly levels it showed us exactly
00:13:24.939 where this move was kind of going now
00:13:27.819 let's swap over to the daily right and
00:13:30.430 part of this is just you know
00:13:31.600 identifying all these levels and let's
00:13:33.610 swap over to daily hey let's take our
00:13:37.180 level or our tool here and start marking
00:13:41.589 out some some daily levels we have a
00:13:43.750 swing log here right
00:13:46.670 I have this swing well
00:13:49.380 that's not gonna mark out any level that
00:13:51.840 that's when high there is not going to
00:13:53.100 be a new level
00:13:58.140 that's right there swimming all right
00:14:00.330 here oops
00:14:01.680 Magna tools being funny and actually
00:14:04.050 this is this daily level creates our
00:14:05.280 monthly level in the future as you can
00:14:06.690 see so we don't we don't need this
00:14:07.980 either because this one and this one are
00:14:10.200 basically creating that monthly level in
00:14:12.120 the future so we've already identified
00:14:12.900 that monthly now if we were back in time
00:14:15.090 back here right so say if we drag this
00:14:17.250 out and we were back here we would
00:14:18.420 identify those right like this would be
00:14:19.920 the level etc cetera
00:14:22.860 we'd be identifying those in the moment
00:14:24.450 but the second we identify that that
00:14:25.740 monthly there there's no need for
00:14:27.090 anything else and then then same with
00:14:29.220 right here right that's just the future
00:14:30.840 monthly bubbles so these daily levels
00:14:32.280 would have defined the future monthly
00:14:33.510 level but we don't need those because we
00:14:35.490 can see we already have them marked out
00:14:36.630 at a larger timeframe
00:14:40.000 okay coming through this move here
00:14:42.930 everything is marked up within these
00:14:44.709 monthlies we don't we don't even really
00:14:45.939 need to mark out anything else MDA ends
00:14:48.699 up being one of these coins that it
00:14:51.160 already has levels basically marked out
00:14:52.899 from the from the monthly
00:14:56.520 doesn't even really need anything else
00:15:00.490 let's just make sure let's go through
00:15:02.510 that's okay we come up we come down it's
00:15:04.070 not a level it's not a level coming down
00:15:06.080 we've already marked out this weekly
00:15:08.120 here it's not a level this is where that
00:15:09.529 weekly starts there there's nothing in
00:15:11.570 here that's dictating levels you know
00:15:14.540 we're just bouncing between these two
00:15:15.860 zones
00:15:20.259 up to the current so what would I be
00:15:23.259 doing in this move right now and and how
00:15:25.720 would I analyze this basically just
00:15:27.009 after after looking at levels and seeing
00:15:29.559 what's happening with this move what I
00:15:31.899 do okay
00:15:33.629 first thing I would do is I would look
00:15:36.399 at the trends so I would be taking the
00:15:38.499 beginning of this move up so the bottom
00:15:40.839 of that move up up to the swing high and
00:15:43.869 actually we're gonna use the swing high
00:15:45.789 over the move because if we were to
00:15:47.350 break this down right now we're on the
00:15:48.459 daily but at some point this would break
00:15:50.019 down into being the very top of the
00:15:52.959 swing high so whether it's on an hourly
00:15:54.549 chart a 4-hour or even a 15-minute chart
00:15:57.009 somewhere in one of those charts this
00:15:58.179 would be the swing high and this would
00:15:59.410 be the swing low of the move right so
00:16:01.689 I'm going to start analyzing what this
00:16:04.029 has done I would have seen this swing
00:16:07.720 low first and I would have let's turn
00:16:09.519 the magnet tool off I would have
00:16:10.539 identified that swing low right like
00:16:13.329 that and that swing high right there and
00:16:15.399 that's as best as it's gonna let me get
00:16:17.769 and I would have seen that it broke the
00:16:18.939 wedge and moved down so I would have
00:16:20.379 started to just evolve this wedge out
00:16:22.389 following this trend pattern here
00:16:24.160 looking for the next swing low which
00:16:26.679 ends up being right here so let's line
00:16:30.279 that up a little better you can call it
00:16:33.639 like that that's fine you're not gonna
00:16:36.249 get it to line up perfectly on on
00:16:37.660 tradingview sometimes
00:16:40.680 you know breaks down here pulling this
00:16:43.930 wedge out so I would be looking for the
00:16:46.870 patterns that this is in an allege and
00:16:49.300 this is it right here right so we can
00:16:51.070 see that there is no real swing low this
00:16:54.699 as has seen yet bad that that to me
00:16:57.550 looks like it still needs to see a swing
00:16:59.709 low now whether it's going to or not I'm
00:17:01.389 not sure but that to me looks like it
00:17:03.070 still needs to see a swing low that this
00:17:05.589 trend has to break so I would probably
00:17:07.240 just expand this out like this just to
00:17:09.400 the bottom to create a peak here so what
00:17:11.589 I would be doing is I would be expanding
00:17:14.109 this wedge out to this point right here
00:17:15.750 this point right here is is where I
00:17:18.369 would put that kind of this and instead
00:17:21.250 of making a wedge because we don't
00:17:22.599 really have a swing low anymore like you
00:17:24.669 know right here we have a swing low
00:17:25.959 which was this whoops which was this so
00:17:29.650 we could define this wedge right you
00:17:33.250 know going going further we kind of had
00:17:35.080 a swing low here right here but now we
00:17:40.870 don't really have a swing low so what I
00:17:42.220 would do is I would just then define
00:17:43.929 this as a peak right so that that's the
00:17:47.380 way I would be looking at this and I
00:17:48.700 would be lining up these trend lines
00:17:52.299 right here and looking to see waiting
00:17:54.700 for this thing to break and waiting for
00:17:56.740 some sideways movement outside of this
00:17:58.360 valley to see what it's doing next but
00:18:00.010 because we haven't seen a swing low I
00:18:01.360 might expect it to test down to this
00:18:03.460 monthly level now what would I do in
00:18:08.470 this trade I know that we are writing a
00:18:11.200 monthly bubble right now so we've
00:18:12.940 already defined that we are we are
00:18:14.559 looking at a monthly level right here we
00:18:20.710 already know we're looking at this
00:18:21.760 silver monthly level and you can see we
00:18:23.169 touch down once we touch down twice
00:18:25.090 looks like we're trying to move sideways
00:18:26.620 but I you know to me this looks like
00:18:28.360 projection it looks like we've touched
00:18:29.530 down on monthly once a second day we're
00:18:32.260 touching down again and if we swap this
00:18:33.910 to the weekly what would it look like
00:18:34.929 right it just looks like it's still
00:18:36.760 moving down and it still has room to
00:18:39.190 move before it's moving on to this trend
00:18:40.960 sideways so
00:18:43.809 I am looking at this on the daily level
00:18:46.179 and I am seeing it starting to develop
00:18:47.770 this pattern of it's touched once it's
00:18:50.890 gonna get rejected 90 percent of the
00:18:52.270 time there its first touch right it's
00:18:54.150 establishing the first touch of this 90
00:18:57.010 percent of time it's being rejected now
00:18:59.559 I'm looking at this next day off this
00:19:02.980 first touch you should have some kind of
00:19:05.470 first touch bounce right you should have
00:19:07.570 some kind of first touch of the level
00:19:09.460 and bounce up just like right here when
00:19:11.110 this kind of this this area right here
00:19:13.150 right we first touch this level we
00:19:15.340 bounce up not a big bounce but it's a
00:19:17.559 bounce this is not this is with and this
00:19:20.020 is not a bounce this is just kind of the
00:19:21.820 the continuation of that bleed right so
00:19:24.370 we established first touch here we come
00:19:26.710 up and then we break on first test right
00:19:28.690 because that's the way it works you
00:19:29.650 first touch and you're gonna reject
00:19:31.120 ninety percent of time and then you
00:19:32.320 first test it and upon first test that's
00:19:34.419 the target right the objective of first
00:19:36.130 test is to break the level so you know
00:19:38.590 first touch first test break so right
00:19:42.190 now I can see we first touched you know
00:19:44.289 ninety percent of time I'm expecting
00:19:45.669 some kind of bounce up we may still
00:19:48.820 bounce up off this it may be a two day
00:19:51.250 pattern or a weekly pattern but I would
00:19:53.740 fully expect to now be looking to test
00:19:55.870 out to here and I need to kind of verify
00:19:58.809 that because I have two levels in here
00:20:01.179 so I have a weekly level and I have it
00:20:02.830 is monthly level so I kind of need to
00:20:04.090 verify like what's my buy target on this
00:20:05.919 where am i buying and why so but the
00:20:08.230 first thing I'm doing here now is I've
00:20:09.460 identified what I think this coin is
00:20:11.260 gonna be doing and right I could be
00:20:12.909 wrong this could move up and I could
00:20:14.380 miss an opportunity so let's talk about
00:20:16.059 that for a second if this is wrong and I
00:20:19.179 miss the opportunity to buy no love no
00:20:21.700 loss because I never entered the coin
00:20:22.990 profits not not seen or our just profits
00:20:25.900 not seen there's always another coin
00:20:27.010 always another trade right you can't
00:20:28.870 always be perfect and you can't make
00:20:30.100 every single perfect entry every single
00:20:31.870 perfect trade the only thing you can do
00:20:33.220 is assess the rules that you have made
00:20:34.870 and by rules what I mean is that this
00:20:37.870 chart right these are my rules this is
00:20:40.510 an art this is a very creative process I
00:20:42.850 have defined these rules so these lines
00:20:45.400 are my rules okay so I need to sit here
00:20:50.200 and say I've defined a set of rules
00:20:52.890 now which rule am I going to apply to my
00:20:57.460 tree
00:20:57.760 for me what I'm looking at right now if
00:21:00.430 if I'm going based on my rules I would
00:21:03.730 want to enter on this down here this
00:21:06.130 touch down here now I have to I have to
00:21:07.810 I have to make some kind of sense of
00:21:09.430 that I can't just pick an arbitrary
00:21:10.360 level and and just say oh I want to
00:21:12.100 enter there and and just because it's a
00:21:13.780 monthly that's sometimes it's not enough
00:21:15.490 I want some kind of confirmation so I'm
00:21:17.110 gonna kind of go back in my chart here
00:21:18.880 and there's a swing high that gets
00:21:22.570 created here so there's a there's a peak
00:21:24.010 that gets created here okay so I kind of
00:21:27.100 have two confirmations now I have this
00:21:29.050 peak swing high here on the daily so in
00:21:31.330 this move here as we zoom out I have
00:21:35.170 this peak swing high here so in this
00:21:37.360 move and you know in this in this move
00:21:40.630 that started down here and moved all the
00:21:41.950 way up over two or three weeks or
00:21:43.690 whatever this is I have a swing high in
00:21:45.520 this peak here
00:21:46.240 that's swing high is lining up with my
00:21:47.830 monthly so if I were to look at this
00:21:50.790 target from here the level would be
00:21:53.680 right here is what I'm targeting on this
00:21:56.050 move so for that reason because there's
00:21:58.630 something so apparent on my chart right
00:22:00.730 in the immediate past because of this
00:22:03.070 it's very apparent right like this is
00:22:05.140 this is the direct move up right before
00:22:06.880 because of this I would be looking at a
00:22:09.100 target of this area in here that's where
00:22:11.680 I would be entering this coin now I
00:22:13.030 don't know how this is gonna play out
00:22:14.620 and this is kind of the fun right this
00:22:16.090 is the fun of doing these live trades
00:22:18.010 because then you guys can see how this
00:22:19.660 unfold in the future and I could like I
00:22:21.160 said I could be wrong but you don't lose
00:22:24.370 money when you're wrong by not entering
00:22:25.960 a trade if I'm saying I'm entering here
00:22:27.670 and all the sudden my way that starts
00:22:29.890 doing this thing hey am night moon who
00:22:31.720 knows I don't know I have a pretty good
00:22:34.480 idea
00:22:34.990 I I don't think it's we're gonna see
00:22:36.220 this but if I don't enter this no love
00:22:39.100 no loss I can move on to my next chart
00:22:40.690 and it's just like okay well you are
00:22:42.490 looking for good entries on coins right
00:22:44.110 so I know that my target based on my
00:22:48.700 rules I am looking at this right here as
00:22:51.460 entry I am looking at the swing high of
00:22:53.410 this kind of last peak that was created
00:22:55.390 this last peak right here that's created
00:22:57.610 right I'm looking at the swing high of
00:22:59.500 that and this is a daily peak so I'm
00:23:00.970 going to turn it red
00:23:03.340 right so this this is this is kind of a
00:23:06.009 daily move I lied I've identified and is
00:23:08.200 it a weekly move - it is a weekly move -
00:23:09.820 so I'm actually going to identify this
00:23:11.110 as purple
00:23:16.290 because again going back to the time
00:23:19.650 frames lesson we want to identify these
00:23:22.440 things based on the level of their
00:23:23.610 strengths right so if you can identify
00:23:24.570 this on a weekly it's important
00:23:26.280 information to know that if you're
00:23:27.780 looking at a target and you know the the
00:23:30.810 stronger the confirmations you have the
00:23:33.000 more likely it is that you're gonna find
00:23:34.200 support there if this was a four hour
00:23:35.970 peak like okay well whatever doesn't
00:23:37.740 matter but you know four hour of peak
00:23:40.320 maybe something like this right here
00:23:41.520 this little tiny pattern right here that
00:23:43.230 that's not gonna that's not what I'm
00:23:44.910 targeting this is this is a peak that
00:23:46.350 was created over how many weeks right so
00:23:48.840 in this trade I have set my rules I have
00:23:50.790 looked at this thing I have charted it I
00:23:52.230 am looking for entry down in here now
00:23:54.120 what am I gonna do next I'm gonna set a
00:23:55.440 notification so what am I gonna expect
00:23:57.930 to happen if I expect entry I want to
00:24:02.040 first off I don't want to enter on radon
00:24:06.510 right on my monthly level at thirteen
00:24:09.030 thousand seven hundred and ninety-one
00:24:10.260 because it could only touch the top of
00:24:12.690 this peak which is fourteen thousand one
00:24:14.130 hundred or nine or people could stop at
00:24:15.630 out a hundred SATs up so for me what I
00:24:17.940 want to do is oops oops here we go
00:24:23.190 I want to create a notification so on
00:24:24.630 trading view I'm gonna go into this
00:24:26.550 clock here and I'm gonna hit set new
00:24:29.280 alert write MD is a coin when it crosses
00:24:33.660 right so when it goes to a value and I'm
00:24:36.870 gonna set the value so I'm gonna say
00:24:38.220 fourteen thousand two hundred all I'm
00:24:39.690 gonna say factually I'm gonna say
00:24:40.920 fifteen thousand but my buy intent is
00:24:42.840 fourteen thousand two hundred right so
00:24:45.270 I'm gonna say fifteen thousand only once
00:24:47.940 and I'm going to put open-ended so I
00:24:51.450 want to know when this target gets hit I
00:24:52.800 don't want to have an expiration date on
00:24:53.970 it if I don't click this open-ended
00:24:55.320 what's gonna happen is it's gonna just
00:24:57.060 expire based on the default data sets
00:24:59.520 and I think it's uh what is that twenty
00:25:01.160 forty eight hours it's setting so it's
00:25:03.540 setting a 48-hour clock by the looks of
00:25:05.010 it or twenty so right there twenty three
00:25:06.900 hours and 27 seconds so it's it's
00:25:09.720 setting a clock so I just want to go to
00:25:11.190 open end because I just wanted to you
00:25:12.900 know could set in this range for five or
00:25:14.370 six days but I want to set this
00:25:15.630 notification so that when it does go
00:25:17.640 there
00:25:17.940 I can I can enter my trade right if it's
00:25:20.700 gonna show pop-up and you know play a
00:25:22.230 sound and you know however you want that
00:25:24.000 message delivered to you I you know I
00:25:25.380 click send SMS because I like it to my
00:25:27.390 cell phone and
00:25:28.949 you know MDA crossing 1500 and I'm gonna
00:25:31.719 hit create so now when MDA crosses this
00:25:34.989 zone here that you can see these orange
00:25:36.969 marks it's gonna notify me because I
00:25:38.469 want to be aware that it's crossing this
00:25:40.299 level and what I would do then is I
00:25:44.320 would set my stop loss regardless so so
00:25:47.679 here right I want to see what's
00:25:49.209 happening and when it when it gets to
00:25:50.769 this point I'm gonna set my buy now what
00:25:53.589 I'm gonna do for my buy is I am going to
00:25:58.049 do it like this I'm gonna set a stop
00:26:02.709 limit okay
00:26:06.690 come on there we go I'm gonna set a stop
00:26:09.720 limit right a stop order so I want to
00:26:13.679 when this coin processes 14200 and let's
00:26:18.539 say 210 SATs right so what is this is
00:26:23.779 0.0001 for 210 and there's this is a
00:26:27.059 very good tip so this is something that
00:26:28.559 is very valuable for you guys and I'll
00:26:30.389 probably talk about this a few times and
00:26:31.799 this is a very good tip if I want the
00:26:34.019 price to be triggered price triggers at
00:26:39.119 fourteen thousand two hundred and ten I
00:26:42.090 want to purchase that and a copy pieces
00:26:47.940 for a little bit of quickness
00:26:51.179 I want to purchase at fourteen 209 now
00:26:55.409 the reason I do this and don't do a book
00:26:57.389 by is because let's put this up here and
00:27:02.909 let's put this here
00:27:05.540 let's get some a little bit of spacing
00:27:08.360 here and let's increase this font size
00:27:10.010 the reason I'm doing this is because if
00:27:14.720 someone decides to sell 50 Bitcoin at
00:27:21.460 14200 what's gonna happen right if
00:27:24.650 someone's dumping into this level what's
00:27:26.809 gonna happen is I'm not gonna buy it
00:27:28.549 14200 10 my purchase is actually gonna
00:27:31.669 be averaged down so my purchase is
00:27:34.100 actually gonna be if they enter 13,800 I
00:27:37.760 will be buying that at thirteen thousand
00:27:39.410 eight hundred or whatever it ends up a
00:27:40.760 virgin I am not buying at fourteen
00:27:42.710 thousand two hundred and nine I am
00:27:44.540 buying based on their average down so
00:27:47.390 it's a way right and this is a very
00:27:49.250 valuable tip for you guys this is a way
00:27:51.530 that you can buy a coin cheaper without
00:27:55.309 having your order on the book you can
00:27:57.410 buy a coin cheaper than actually having
00:28:00.010 the purchase price on the book
00:28:02.059 and-and-and clicking clicking commit to
00:28:03.919 buy right in one way you're catching a
00:28:06.950 falling knife because price is moving
00:28:08.870 down into it's smashing down but that's
00:28:11.000 why we set the notification because this
00:28:13.910 thing could dump down six hundred six
00:28:16.070 thousand SATs right like you guys have
00:28:17.780 seen it it could go all the way down to
00:28:18.890 twelve thousand and you obviously bought
00:28:20.330 way too high so we want to have a
00:28:22.100 notification saying at fifteen thousand
00:28:24.410 alert us that this trade is at that
00:28:26.720 price so that I can analyze this and if
00:28:29.240 I see that it just looks like it's gonna
00:28:31.340 test this level I want to buy it the
00:28:33.559 best price so I'm setting my target
00:28:35.240 whatever my target is I'm setting it and
00:28:36.799 I'm averaging down my purchase because
00:28:39.260 someone's gonna sell a large amount and
00:28:41.030 your orders not going to be on the book
00:28:42.260 so if someone's sitting at fourteen
00:28:43.640 thousand two hundred with one Bitcoin
00:28:45.110 and they decide to sell ten Bitcoin down
00:28:48.260 all the way to fourteen thousand you may
00:28:49.580 pick up you know whatever your order
00:28:51.470 sizes for fourteen thousand two hundred
00:28:54.410 cents less or or whatever it may be but
00:28:56.540 it's I've had I've I I've seen orders
00:29:01.730 that I get twenty percent less the cost
00:29:03.590 based on what has been because somebody
00:29:05.600 saw puts puts up some crazy order where
00:29:07.610 they're you know if my buy was at
00:29:10.040 fourteen thousand 209 and I usually make
00:29:12.320 them a little tighter like for it for
00:29:13.640 myself I usually do this because I go to
00:29:15.500 psychological levels where I know people
00:29:17.030 are gonna
00:29:18.019 dump like crazy and I'll go 14:03 by it
00:29:21.129 14:02 something like that I'll get
00:29:23.659 closer to psychological levels so that
00:29:25.159 you know as it's preaching that for as
00:29:27.559 it's approaching that 14200 level you
00:29:30.769 know someone might smash down a thousand
00:29:32.299 SATs and i'll buy down where they boy
00:29:34.009 they put it down right so a very good
00:29:36.649 tip I've actually purchased I've had
00:29:40.009 purchases on coins that were at a
00:29:41.389 thousand SATs and I've purchased them
00:29:42.769 down as as cheap as 700 SATs in a flash
00:29:46.129 dump in something that looks like this
00:29:48.320 where you know somebody sells here and
00:29:50.240 your order may be here at 26,000 but
00:29:52.909 then you end up getting at a 23 because
00:29:54.470 it was just some some cowboy who did a
00:29:57.619 flash move right it's some you know rock
00:30:00.499 star who's just yeah let's dump the
00:30:02.179 market but then people reject price
00:30:03.470 right so that's that's part of the art
00:30:04.730 part of the science behind it is it's
00:30:07.039 finding those levels like identifying
00:30:08.779 the correct levels as a science and then
00:30:10.220 part of the art is you know taking
00:30:11.749 advantage of situations like that
00:30:13.340 so that's how I would set up this trade
00:30:15.980 and that's where I'd be looking to take
00:30:19.070 an entry on a milena and I would be
00:30:21.619 looking to stop out somewhere let's talk
00:30:25.039 about that for a second so I would look
00:30:27.590 to buy let's call it 14100 let's say I
00:30:30.080 buy at the level let's say identify this
00:30:31.490 perfectly and I bought at 14100 I'm
00:30:34.789 probably selling out a couple percent
00:30:39.289 below my entry based on your own
00:30:42.200 assessment you guys have to make you
00:30:43.970 your own assessment based on your
00:30:45.919 comfort levels and your risk tolerance
00:30:46.999 and things like that if I'm buying a
00:30:49.929 14100 I might want to stop out at 13,000
00:30:53.350 it's got to be under thirteen thousand
00:30:55.580 seven hundred ninety-one and I would say
00:30:58.129 probably a little bit below that so
00:31:00.919 maybe thirteen thousand six ninety five
00:31:03.440 is where I would stop out and so so what
00:31:05.480 is that four hundred SATs four hundred
00:31:08.960 SATs on a fourteen thousand coin what is
00:31:12.049 that oh god it's late my brain hurts
00:31:14.950 okay okay so let's say roughly four
00:31:18.590 hundred SATs
00:31:19.399 fourteen hundred would be ten percent
00:31:21.499 one hundred and forty would be one
00:31:23.539 percent so that's 280
00:31:26.950 that's 380 420 yeah roughly three and a
00:31:31.120 half percent under that that's pretty
00:31:32.350 risky with that said I may set my my by
00:31:37.360 target here I may see what happens and
00:31:39.399 wait for this coin to touch here and
00:31:41.889 move sideways so I could take a little
00:31:43.210 bit of a more aggressive stance on this
00:31:44.649 level and maybe stop out you know two
00:31:46.929 percent under 13,000 so so 300 points
00:31:51.039 under 13,000 790 so maybe 7-7 13,500 to
00:31:56.470 make it not not quite 2% so that that's
00:31:59.500 the way I would look at it right I would
00:32:00.700 I would see what the coins doing a
00:32:01.750 fifteen thousand SATs and I've have my
00:32:03.399 level set and then if I get stopped out
00:32:06.220 in two and I end up getting this for
00:32:08.139 thirteen thousand five hundred or
00:32:09.309 something then I have a really good risk
00:32:11.830 tolerance because then I can stop out at
00:32:13.299 13 for right and and it's only a hundred
00:32:15.309 SATs and I and I know I'm ahead of the
00:32:16.840 curve so kind of a bit of an insider's
00:32:19.750 tip for the market or kind of you know
00:32:21.250 something that you see at a professional
00:32:23.440 level
00:32:24.220 you know these stop orders and how to
00:32:25.899 properly manage them you guys will
00:32:27.370 practice that and get experience with it
00:32:28.809 and hopefully get really good and catch
00:32:30.610 these crazy orders because I've had a
00:32:31.990 few where I've you know well I've had
00:32:34.299 more than a few have had I've had very
00:32:35.620 I've had a quite a few where I've bought
00:32:37.750 a coin twenty or thirty or forty percent
00:32:39.519 below what was meant to be sold the
00:32:41.649 intent that was meant to be sold you
00:32:43.750 know things like this down here what
00:32:45.820 happens in one minute or this down here
00:32:47.590 this here some level so I'm leveling
00:32:49.389 here that only it's only happening for
00:32:51.130 you know a course of you know one
00:32:53.649 hundred and twenty seconds two minutes
00:32:55.240 or three or four minutes or you know why
00:32:57.309 not so that's a little tip on how you
00:32:59.260 catch those big spike orders down it's
00:33:03.279 all in stop orders and you know practice
00:33:05.019 it get used to it and that's how I'd
00:33:06.399 look at this coin and that's the the
00:33:07.870 trade I would take and I'm not gonna
00:33:09.940 panic you know to go over this again
00:33:12.220 if this coin all the sudden starts to
00:33:14.799 move up I'm not I don't care like I
00:33:17.080 don't care onto the next one
00:33:18.850 I'm not gonna beat myself up over it I
00:33:20.950 didn't miss an opportunity I didn't make
00:33:22.809 a mistake I didn't you know enter the
00:33:26.350 position incorrectly I didn't I didn't
00:33:28.720 do any of those things right I've
00:33:30.399 assessed this coin based on my rule set
00:33:32.529 and I said this is my target and if I
00:33:34.929 buy there great if not I don't and I
00:33:37.899 cleared off my alerts for this video but
00:33:40.330 they all have about 30 to 40 alerts on
00:33:42.430 my charts so as I missed this one
00:33:45.010 another ones popping up within half an
00:33:46.900 hour so I you know some you know I go
00:33:49.270 through these assessment periods of five
00:33:51.820 to ten coins a day where they've hit
00:33:53.470 targets and I look at these targets and
00:33:55.660 and you know if I have ten coins that
00:33:57.610 have hit a target that day and I'm
00:33:59.020 saying I've identified this as a
00:34:00.820 purchase right I've identified this as a
00:34:03.580 coin that I want to enter based on this
00:34:05.260 level being hit because we just crossed
00:34:06.820 that and I know you know we're now or a
00:34:08.469 bye zone if I've got ten of these a day
00:34:10.780 I can pick the best three or best four
00:34:12.880 or best five a day and I can just take
00:34:14.830 those positions and then you
00:34:16.510 continuously do that I don't it doesn't
00:34:18.250 matter to me if this one coin moves up I
00:34:20.199 don't it doesn't matter I can just on to
00:34:22.480 the next one right and I can take
00:34:23.980 Rockstar positions all day long and you
00:34:26.889 know you don't have to stress it but
00:34:28.210 your rules have to be bang on right
00:34:30.340 that's the thing that's the art of this
00:34:31.989 that's that's the science and the art is
00:34:33.820 that you create the ruleset right you
00:34:36.010 create these these these bounds that
00:34:39.400 this this lives by and you're the one
00:34:41.590 who makes that creative approach and
00:34:45.909 take our story takes that creative
00:34:47.350 approach and makes that process and
00:34:48.668 designs a strike nobody else designs
00:34:50.350 this chart right it's up to you so
00:34:52.739 that's how I would take this live trait
00:34:55.719 and then where would I exit you know I
00:34:58.270 would assess that at the time I would
00:35:00.250 just be looking at you know levels and I
00:35:02.500 mean I won't get into where I'm gonna
00:35:03.850 exit because I don't drag this video on
00:35:06.640 way too long I think for a final video
00:35:09.100 where I were when I exit will get into
00:35:10.900 you know stuff like that and other live
00:35:12.250 trades are I plan to do quite a few live
00:35:14.170 trades over the course of this material
00:35:16.750 and yeah so I think we're gonna leave it
00:35:19.060 at that if I had to give you guys a live
00:35:22.360 exit right now I don't know what is this
00:35:25.170 buying at thirteen thousand South at
00:35:28.300 eighteen don't don't be greedy sell at
00:35:30.280 the weekly heck if you buy a 13-9 and
00:35:32.740 you sell at sixteen you know that's
00:35:35.500 twenty three hundred SATs or twenty two
00:35:37.060 hundred and nine SATs or sorry two
00:35:40.810 thousand two hundred and nine two
00:35:41.980 thousand SATs on a thirteen thousand
00:35:43.750 side entry is a fifteen percent or
00:35:45.730 something like that quick math fifteen
00:35:47.230 percent that's a heck of an entry
00:35:48.570 that's a that's a heck of a trade when I
00:35:50.250 have five other trades going on that day
00:35:51.810 if I can get 15% on that one coin over
00:35:53.640 three days and you know this is all it
00:35:55.680 took me to do it I'm happy 15% is 15%
00:36:00.030 that's you know very nice
00:36:04.170 all right so let's go over our list one

# Day Trade Strategy Series 1 Hold Levels
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/CPxA4X8IAtc

00:00:00.320 hi and welcome to my strategy series in
00:00:02.480 these videos we're going to be looking
00:00:03.520 at quick ways to analyze the markets and
00:00:05.200 in this video we're going to be looking
00:00:06.319 at hold levels first off a whole level
00:00:08.559 is exactly what it sounds like it's a
00:00:10.080 level that must hold the price now how
00:00:12.160 we define hold levels is by a body or a
00:00:14.320 wick of a candle it either could be the
00:00:16.160 wick of a candle which represents the
00:00:17.520 test of that exact level or the body as
00:00:19.840 the greediest point of that same level
00:00:21.359 or maybe something deeper in the time
00:00:22.720 frame so when you're deciding between a
00:00:24.320 body or a wick first off important to
00:00:26.400 know that either can be a test of a
00:00:27.760 level so in this case it didn't test the
00:00:29.199 body of this move but if you actually
00:00:30.960 went here it did test the wick which is
00:00:32.960 the same thing as testing the body it
00:00:34.559 just has to test one of the other and
00:00:36.160 typically why this happens is because
00:00:37.600 the body of a candle acts as the
00:00:38.800 greediest point which sometimes can be a
00:00:40.719 hold level on a different time frame
00:00:42.559 which is the wick on a different time
00:00:43.840 frame or the body of a time frame within
00:00:45.440 time frames within time frames or it's
00:00:47.520 the actual wick testing maybe the back
00:00:49.200 side of the front side of it so a whole
00:00:51.199 level can be anything that's a wick or a
00:00:52.960 body it tests one time and that's it now
00:00:55.760 when you are buying hole levels you need
00:00:57.600 to realize that on the bottom side of
00:00:59.039 your chart you need to use the opposing
00:01:00.800 color than what is on the top side of
00:01:02.079 your chart so for example if you were to
00:01:03.680 use the bottom side of this candle well
00:01:06.479 you would have that exact
00:01:08.640 handle here you would not have the same
00:01:10.560 color candle it's going to be opposing
00:01:12.320 candles so when you're trying to hold a
00:01:14.080 level in accumulation it's going to be a
00:01:16.159 distribution candle and when you are
00:01:17.680 shorting or holding a candle in
00:01:19.119 distribution it's going to be an
00:01:20.159 accumulation candle so important to know
00:01:22.320 a whole level must be one of those two
00:01:23.920 things and opposing sides now how do you
00:01:26.799 use hold levels hold levels represent
00:01:28.479 that they are trying to hold the price
00:01:30.320 going in that same direction so if you
00:01:32.400 were to use a whole level what you want
00:01:33.600 to do is you want to create a rule at
00:01:35.040 first it says okay this level has been
00:01:37.040 tested once already okay so that's great
00:01:39.280 this one's tested we can no longer use
00:01:40.799 it we're gonna leave it there to follow
00:01:42.000 the trail well the next hold level if
00:01:43.840 you were to follow this with your eyes
00:01:45.280 from this point here straight over and
00:01:47.439 up the next one would be right there
00:01:48.960 that's the lowest one connected to that
00:01:50.880 point so you can use that same candle
00:01:53.840 you could use the body or the wick so
00:01:55.520 we're just gonna mark the oh okay you
00:01:57.520 know what we'll mark the wick we'll keep
00:01:58.560 all things even here and you can see
00:02:00.240 that's exactly the level it had tested
00:02:02.000 so you're not gonna go and test this
00:02:03.119 whole level as it's already been tested
00:02:04.560 but you will be testing this one now
00:02:07.119 here's a cool thing about hold levels
00:02:10.239 a really smart way to use them when you
00:02:12.400 are trying to set a strategy what you do
00:02:14.480 is you always use the highest time frame
00:02:16.560 is down so what we're going to do here
00:02:17.520 is we're going to go to the daily time
00:02:18.720 frame of course there's nothing on the
00:02:19.920 daily here it is too short of an
00:02:21.599 interval of time aha but we do have the
00:02:23.520 daily over here okay so we have a whole
00:02:25.599 level here but now here's where it gets
00:02:27.360 interesting this is where you dig down
00:02:29.440 into your levels to say i want to test
00:02:31.599 things that are on a lower time frame
00:02:33.920 but completes the same test so anything
00:02:37.200 from this moment down would technically
00:02:38.959 be testing the daily level well how do
00:02:40.959 you decide where to put a buy order you
00:02:42.560 can go down in time frames and see hey
00:02:45.200 where are all the levels inside of these
00:02:47.040 candles that represent an untested
00:02:49.440 moment because hey if a candle went
00:02:51.599 straight down like this a big wick
00:02:52.959 happened maybe it's testing the daily
00:02:54.720 but maybe it's also testing the four
00:02:56.000 hour the one hour the 15 and so forth
00:02:57.840 and so forth so really great strategy
00:02:59.840 and we're going to change the color of
00:03:00.959 these candles is to go like this and you
00:03:03.760 go
00:03:04.400 and
00:03:05.200 dig down into time frames so red is
00:03:07.040 daily yellow is four hour go make a blue
00:03:09.440 one which is the one hour time frame
00:03:12.239 and what we're going to do is we're just
00:03:13.200 going to cut this off here use the
00:03:14.480 replayer tool
00:03:16.239 right there and we can mark the one hour
00:03:18.480 here
00:03:19.440 which is right there
00:03:20.879 color that blue keep this nice and
00:03:24.560 organized and if there's a 15 minute
00:03:26.159 well we'll color that another color too
00:03:28.319 and so you can see the 15 minute
00:03:29.760 actually is below this right here so we
00:03:32.799 can say the 15 minute is here but
00:03:34.640 technically the test of this 15 minute
00:03:36.720 level well it would actually be right
00:03:38.879 here is the lowest one this is the
00:03:40.640 untested one
00:03:42.080 and right here kind of suffices as that
00:03:44.799 same level as well this is tested so
00:03:46.720 right here so anything
00:03:48.959 and that's tested two so you could go
00:03:50.799 right here and you mark this one as gray
00:03:55.920 so now you've got all your levels marked
00:03:58.159 out so typically what's going to happen
00:04:00.159 and this i don't think we need to go any
00:04:01.360 further okay you know what let's let's
00:04:02.400 mark a five minute level as well let's
00:04:03.840 just make sure we uh
00:04:06.080 do all of our work here to mark all of
00:04:07.840 the levels and the five-minute level is
00:04:09.360 right there this one is already tested
00:04:10.879 as you can see so this would be the next
00:04:12.480 one that's untested so you've got kind
00:04:14.080 of everything in the moment that could
00:04:16.720 count for hey we're dumping the markets
00:04:18.880 what level are we going to hold so let's
00:04:21.040 talk about this for a second because
00:04:22.240 this is crucial to developing our
00:04:23.600 strategies
00:04:25.120 in a moment where you are going to test
00:04:26.639 a daily level realize the only thing
00:04:29.360 that it has to do is close over top of
00:04:32.400 this level here and we're going to mark
00:04:34.000 this one a different color we're going
00:04:35.120 to go with a red that's not quite the
00:04:37.919 same red maybe something a little
00:04:39.199 lighter and we're just going to make it
00:04:40.240 thicker so really the only thing it
00:04:41.759 needs to do if it wants to test this
00:04:43.520 daily level is it can test all the way
00:04:45.919 down into the depths of this daily level
00:04:48.000 far all the way down to the one hour the
00:04:49.520 15 as long as it's closing over top of
00:04:53.120 that greedy point on the daily candle
00:04:55.280 the body of the candle as long as it's
00:04:56.880 closing over top of that or not hard
00:04:59.040 closing underneath this line and if you
00:05:01.039 want to know what hard closing is going
00:05:02.240 to take future of trading i talk all
00:05:03.360 about hard closing in there so as long
00:05:04.960 as you don't hard close under this it's
00:05:06.400 perfectly fine because what's going to
00:05:08.639 happen a lot of times is it's going to
00:05:09.919 say hey we tested the daily level but we
00:05:11.520 went to the greediest point within that
00:05:13.360 daily level and we still continued to
00:05:15.520 close over top of it so now if we just
00:05:18.000 kind of take the replayer tool off and
00:05:20.000 see exactly where this thing goes well
00:05:21.680 then you have your daily level test and
00:05:23.600 the greediest level inside of that daily
00:05:25.520 level and there might have even been
00:05:26.639 something greedier that we just simply
00:05:28.320 didn't mark out let's go check the three
00:05:29.840 minute
00:05:31.440 check the three minute in the one minute
00:05:32.800 is there anything inside of this that's
00:05:34.479 even deeper in the move well you can
00:05:36.320 find that out by going here and doing
00:05:37.680 your work so this one's tested already
00:05:39.199 can't be that one which means it could
00:05:40.880 be this one well it can't be that one
00:05:42.720 but it could be this one that's already
00:05:44.400 tested well what about this one so it
00:05:46.080 can go as high as this or as low as this
00:05:47.840 it hasn't come over top and tested and
00:05:49.919 what about the one minute is there
00:05:51.039 anything there data's not available too
00:05:52.720 far back no problem we don't really need
00:05:54.639 to know that far back anyways so then
00:05:56.560 when you're looking at this and you're
00:05:57.840 saying hey where can you go in a level
00:06:00.240 and and you test a daily level or a
00:06:02.240 weekly level how deep in that level can
00:06:04.880 you go and you can see that you can
00:06:06.880 actually go quite deep because the level
00:06:08.720 may exist down up here but you can still
00:06:10.880 draw down another almost four percent on
00:06:13.120 this trade as opposed to just taking
00:06:15.280 that greediest point in the move
00:06:18.400 measuring it down and yeah you're within
00:06:20.639 half a percent and then you could get
00:06:22.319 even greedier if you wanted to use some
00:06:23.600 other techniques but this is a really
00:06:24.800 good strategy
00:06:26.080 when you look at hold levels so now if
00:06:28.720 we were to do the same thing here you
00:06:30.160 could probably find some really good
00:06:31.280 opportunities as well i think the daily
00:06:33.120 is a little too
00:06:34.560 fast to say hey we haven't had enough
00:06:36.800 time here let's not use it daily well
00:06:38.720 what about the four hour well that's a
00:06:40.160 great start for the four hour test of
00:06:41.919 the whole double what can live inside of
00:06:43.759 that though well let's go take a look so
00:06:45.919 we're gonna mark this as yellow nice and
00:06:47.840 thin that's what we do for four hour
00:06:49.520 levels we owe the yellow nice and thin
00:06:51.280 let's mark the one hour and you have
00:06:53.440 this here which has already been tested
00:06:55.199 and then it moves up to this year well
00:06:56.639 this one wasn't tested so you have the
00:06:58.560 one hour inside of the four that is
00:07:00.960 showing you hey you can test down to the
00:07:02.720 four hour level and you can actually go
00:07:05.199 and test one time frame deeper while
00:07:06.720 still holding this four hour level so
00:07:08.560 now what you've done is you've gone and
00:07:10.240 you've found the four hour level the
00:07:11.919 strong level in the move and you've gone
00:07:13.840 to the deeper depths of that level that
00:07:15.680 all it has to do is test that and come
00:07:17.680 back over top of it you could go even
00:07:19.520 deeper into the 15 and say hey maybe
00:07:21.360 there's a 15 minute level here
00:07:23.919 well it looks like that 15 minute level
00:07:25.599 would be all the way down here
00:07:29.120 and it could be anywhere from these two
00:07:30.560 you could even be down all the way down
00:07:32.319 here so with marking that let's mark
00:07:34.560 this one as the untested 15 minute level
00:07:36.720 and see what happens here
00:07:39.360 well and that's where we are right now
00:07:40.800 in the move the 15 minute level so by
00:07:42.880 doing this you can go and you can go
00:07:45.280 inside of time frames and find the spots
00:07:47.919 where these trades are going to bounce
00:07:49.759 you can go inside these time frames and
00:07:51.680 say okay we have a range here that
00:07:54.080 actually starts back here from the back
00:07:55.680 side but we have a four hour hold level
00:07:57.440 and if i want to take a greedier entry i
00:07:59.360 can start digging down into time frames
00:08:01.120 and seeing hey there's some smarter
00:08:03.440 trades that happen here and greedier
00:08:05.520 prices that all that has to happen is it
00:08:07.280 has to hit that price and move up so in
00:08:09.680 this case here
00:08:11.440 that's exactly what happened you went
00:08:13.280 after the four hour level by attacking
00:08:15.120 the deeper part of its move and moving
00:08:17.360 over top of it to try to establish a
00:08:19.440 move up well clearly that move up didn't
00:08:21.360 happen and then it went to the next part
00:08:22.879 of its range and you could even go back
00:08:24.720 into here and say okay well what else is
00:08:26.400 inside the 15 minute you could use that
00:08:28.000 same theory all the way down to one or
00:08:29.919 five minute candles or as deep in a move
00:08:32.000 as you want to go and you could say okay
00:08:35.839 well it can't be the five minute level
00:08:37.039 because the five minute levels are
00:08:37.919 already all tested so this five-minute
00:08:39.679 level was tested there so it can't be
00:08:41.200 that level so we can automatically rule
00:08:42.719 out the five-minute level what about if
00:08:43.919 we go deeper is there anything else um
00:08:46.160 the three-minute level same thing it's
00:08:47.760 already been tested and so is this one
00:08:49.200 so you can see uh this level right here
00:08:51.279 has been tested
00:08:52.959 voila tested this one tested can't use
00:08:55.680 that what about the one minute
00:08:57.279 and the one minute it had an untested
00:08:59.279 moment but
00:09:01.760 yeah you you'd have to go pretty deep in
00:09:03.920 this range i don't think we're quite
00:09:05.200 there yet but hey maybe this is the
00:09:06.800 level that can hold up the entire trade
00:09:08.399 because it's a one minute level that's
00:09:10.160 all the way deep down inside of this
00:09:11.680 four hour but you know i think at this
00:09:13.360 point i would feel comfortable taking
00:09:15.680 that 15 minute level and nothing else
00:09:17.680 and it looks like it's not really having
00:09:18.959 any success anyways so this is how you
00:09:21.440 have to treat whole levels and a great
00:09:22.800 strategy moving forward anytime you see
00:09:24.640 a level and you can do the same thing on
00:09:26.399 this side too anytime you see a level on
00:09:28.320 your charts right here
00:09:30.000 here's a backside level for example
00:09:31.760 here's the four hour level right here
00:09:33.200 how can you go further inside of this
00:09:34.880 level to see what actually happened in
00:09:36.560 the move well you could go to the back
00:09:38.560 side on the hourly and then you could go
00:09:40.320 and you could dig down even further in
00:09:42.080 the move and you could find the 15
00:09:43.839 minute level here well looks like this
00:09:45.519 one has been tested here so next you'd
00:09:47.279 be down to here and it looks like this
00:09:49.680 one
00:09:50.720 was already tested there and that's
00:09:52.480 exactly what you get so now you can go
00:09:53.920 even deeper into the move and say well
00:09:55.279 what lies inside of here that's not
00:09:57.040 tested
00:09:58.480 so let's go to a five minute chart see
00:10:00.240 what's exactly happening in the moment
00:10:01.519 right now
00:10:03.040 you're right here this five minute has
00:10:04.959 been tested so you could simply just go
00:10:06.720 to this five minute right here
00:10:11.360 no three minute what about a one minute
00:10:16.240 you have this guy right here
00:10:19.360 take off our replayer tool see exactly
00:10:21.440 what happened
00:10:22.880 and you probably have the deepest part
00:10:24.640 of the range that hasn't been tested
00:10:27.680 let's just hit that auto button that
00:10:29.120 lovely auto button
00:10:31.360 scale it back go to a five minute chart
00:10:32.880 so we can see a bigger time frame and
00:10:34.480 voila you have the greediest part of
00:10:36.399 that entire range as you've diminished
00:10:38.640 down the testing of different levels so
00:10:40.880 this is a great strategy to look at hold
00:10:42.959 levels and it'll give you awesome spots
00:10:44.640 where you can enter the trades and if
00:10:46.480 you're ever wondering what time frame to
00:10:48.720 use you can always go back up in time
00:10:50.800 frame and you can see which levels have
00:10:52.800 been tested so if i had a question here
00:10:54.399 that said hey maybe i should use this
00:10:56.399 five-minute level well i can see that
00:10:58.000 the five-minute level previously had
00:10:59.440 already been tested and if i want to go
00:11:01.519 to that five-minute level i can go
00:11:02.800 deeper inside that to find that original
00:11:04.720 one-minute level that we first found so
00:11:06.399 then you have the one-minute level
00:11:07.680 inside of the five-minute level that's
00:11:09.440 inside of the four-hour level that's
00:11:11.200 inside of the one-hour level that's
00:11:12.640 inside all the other levels so you have
00:11:14.320 the combination of all things combined
00:11:16.800 so you have every single level combined
00:11:19.360 to show you where the point of polarity
00:11:21.440 or the whole level should be so that's
00:11:23.360 your strategy for hold levels start high
00:11:25.600 work your way down and find the spots
00:11:27.200 that are untested with the understanding
00:11:29.279 that as long as you don't close under or
00:11:31.839 above the bigger levels you can still go
00:11:34.000 in that range and then move extremely
00:11:35.680 off of it extremely down or up or
00:11:37.279 whichever direction you want to go just
00:11:39.040 like you saw here with a four hour or
00:11:40.720 just like you saw down here with the one
00:11:42.640 hour so that's a crash on whole levels
00:11:44.880 and a smart way to play them see on the
00:11:46.480 next one

00:00:00.320 hi and welcome to my strategy series in
00:00:02.159 these videos we look at quick ways to
00:00:03.439 analyze the markets in this video we're
00:00:04.960 going to be looking at trends first and
00:00:06.879 foremost the most important thing about
00:00:08.160 trends is marking them out properly in
00:00:10.719 day trading we only ever use
00:00:12.240 accumulation to accumulation from the
00:00:14.080 highest time frame working down on the
00:00:16.720 top side of a chart so what that means
00:00:18.480 is like this accumulation to
00:00:19.760 accumulation on the top side which is uh
00:00:22.000 for me beige and maybe for you guys at
00:00:23.840 home guys and gals it would be green and
00:00:26.320 on the bottom side blue to blue or
00:00:27.840 distribution to distribution again at
00:00:30.480 home this is probably going to be red if
00:00:31.840 your default colors or if you're like me
00:00:33.120 and you like to change it you'll have a
00:00:34.160 different color schema important thing
00:00:36.480 is that it is from distribution to
00:00:38.480 distribution on the bottom side
00:00:40.239 accumulation to accumulation on the top
00:00:42.000 side without any falter and you always
00:00:45.120 work from time frame down as everything
00:00:47.360 in day trading and charting is a
00:00:48.640 de-cycling theory it always recycles and
00:00:50.719 de-cycles itself down to smaller points
00:00:52.640 of break so what we would do here is you
00:00:55.280 mark your candles and you can now be in
00:00:57.280 this trade or you can be looking at the
00:00:59.199 chart and you can move down in time
00:01:01.280 frames to see hey is there anything here
00:01:03.039 on the one hour and before we move down
00:01:04.799 we're going to go up and we're just
00:01:06.159 going to immediately say that there is
00:01:08.159 nothing to use on a daily chart here we
00:01:10.159 don't have enough data yet to even
00:01:11.760 justify using these points the beginning
00:01:14.000 of this would be a four hour chart so
00:01:15.759 that is where we can mark four hour to
00:01:18.159 four hour top and bottom side
00:01:20.080 now if you are to go into your charts
00:01:22.159 and start marking and and trying to
00:01:24.240 adjust these trends what you have to do
00:01:25.920 is you have to work first off down in
00:01:27.759 time frames and second off you have to
00:01:29.520 hard close your trend on the next time
00:01:31.759 frame before you move on
00:01:34.000 so what that means a hard close is when
00:01:36.240 the bottom side of any given candle
00:01:38.240 closes below a level or a trend so in a
00:01:40.960 distribution case the bottom side of
00:01:42.640 that candle would be the top of the body
00:01:45.280 now the reason that is how it is is
00:01:47.600 because when you're distributing you're
00:01:48.960 moving down making the bottom side of a
00:01:50.799 downward movement the top of the
00:01:52.720 distribution candle when you are moving
00:01:54.960 up in the markets the top side would be
00:01:57.439 the top of the adjacent candle so you
00:01:59.920 would be breaking over the bottom of an
00:02:02.320 accumulation candle here or the top of a
00:02:05.119 distribution candle here so that is how
00:02:06.719 you hard close something so if you were
00:02:08.479 to go back to your four hour chart you
00:02:10.160 could simply look at this and you would
00:02:11.360 see this is still moving up because hey
00:02:12.879 it doesn't have the bottom side of a
00:02:14.800 blue candle closing under it yet
00:02:16.239 actually if you zoom in here you're just
00:02:17.920 halfway through a blue candle so
00:02:19.520 actually the first one that does is
00:02:20.879 right here and notice how bitcoin
00:02:22.480 instantly moves down right after it
00:02:24.480 closes that bottom side of a candle so
00:02:27.040 accuracy with trends is a must because
00:02:28.879 we can draw them anywhere unless we have
00:02:30.400 the right trend i call these active
00:02:32.239 trends for butterfly effect two unless
00:02:34.000 we have active trends we understand what
00:02:36.319 an active moment in the charts are we
00:02:38.400 don't have the right information going
00:02:39.599 forward now what i could do in this move
00:02:41.680 is weaken this trend and say hey we're
00:02:43.360 getting ready to break further and
00:02:44.480 further by going down into time frames
00:02:46.640 and what i would do is i would say
00:02:47.920 here's the reach point never adjust the
00:02:49.599 base point the base points always stay
00:02:51.040 on the highest time frame available you
00:02:53.120 never adjust your base point if you've
00:02:54.959 adjusted it go back up into your time
00:02:56.879 frame so if i've adjusted this to some
00:02:58.720 point like this stop right there go back
00:03:01.120 up into your time frame
00:03:02.640 re-snap it even if it looks correct it's
00:03:04.800 not
00:03:05.599 drag it off re-snap it with a magnet
00:03:07.360 tool on and re-snap it back to that
00:03:09.680 candle so now we're going to go down in
00:03:11.599 time frames to the hourly and we're
00:03:12.800 going to hard close the next candle so
00:03:14.640 you can see right here it tried to break
00:03:16.080 that four-hour level by hard closing
00:03:17.440 this so we could in fact get a little
00:03:19.760 bit more accuracy by adjusting this
00:03:22.080 candle to here and aha all of a sudden
00:03:24.640 if you zoom in here it didn't quite
00:03:26.400 break that four hour level the one hour
00:03:27.920 level held slightly above this part of
00:03:30.239 the trend and yes that makes a
00:03:31.440 difference if you're going to ask this
00:03:32.400 is that a little tiny piece really make
00:03:34.000 a difference absolutely it's what
00:03:35.680 dictates and defines everything in the
00:03:37.280 markets is these exact rules so but what
00:03:40.000 does happen is it breaks down here so
00:03:42.080 now you can move this to here and say
00:03:43.680 hey we have a one hour trend and let's
00:03:45.200 see how that gets respected aha it
00:03:47.200 breaks that again trying to break this
00:03:48.640 four hour going back up into time frame
00:03:50.640 and it doesn't manage to break its move
00:03:53.040 right so you can now go and see if you
00:03:55.439 adjust this to the next hard close oh
00:03:57.360 let's control z back make sure we have
00:03:58.799 the right one it is this one indeed this
00:04:00.720 should be what controls the move and
00:04:02.480 breaks the cycle of the entire trade
00:04:04.879 down and as you can see it does if you
00:04:07.439 were to snap it to the next hard close
00:04:09.920 you would be at this blue one right here
00:04:12.400 and you can see the breakdown off of
00:04:13.840 that trend happen once you lose that
00:04:15.760 trend so this is how we work with trends
00:04:17.600 we always de-cycle time frames and
00:04:19.519 de-cycle information and move forward in
00:04:22.720 time we can never go back in time and
00:04:24.960 say oh here's a time frame here because
00:04:27.759 of reason x we can never decide we can
00:04:30.000 never we can never go backwards in time
00:04:31.520 we always have to be moving forwards to
00:04:33.360 the theory of the cycling and the
00:04:35.040 reduction of elements in trades and
00:04:37.280 charts it's what makes the chart spin
00:04:39.120 and what's it's what makes all the magic
00:04:41.040 happen the theory of recycling and
00:04:42.800 decycling time frames compressing down
00:04:45.280 into moments of conjunction and the same
00:04:48.000 thing with the verticality of a chart
00:04:50.560 you can only move forward in these
00:04:52.160 moments and never backwards you can't
00:04:53.840 travel back in time so how could you
00:04:55.360 mark charts backwards as well they
00:04:57.199 didn't exist they weren't active moments
00:04:58.880 in the trades so a good strategy for
00:05:02.160 using trends first and foremost okay
00:05:04.560 number one thing
00:05:06.639 accuracy you have to mark these properly
00:05:09.280 just immediately looking at this chart
00:05:10.960 and going back to my lesson on hold
00:05:12.639 levels if i had seen this and it was
00:05:15.280 trying to let's rewind this trend back
00:05:17.039 at the exact point if i had seen that
00:05:18.960 this trend just got attacked like this
00:05:21.520 i would say hey we're trying to break a
00:05:23.600 one-hour trend where's a one-hour hold
00:05:25.680 level and then i would start going down
00:05:27.280 into my hold levels and be looking for
00:05:29.199 points that could break this move this
00:05:31.039 had already gotten hit i believe you
00:05:32.800 could go down in time frames you could
00:05:34.720 say here's a 15 minute aha that already
00:05:36.880 got hit go to your next 15 minute which
00:05:38.639 is here remember this can accompany
00:05:40.479 anything from this part of the chart to
00:05:42.400 this this had gotten hit already okay
00:05:44.800 let's go to the next part which is right
00:05:46.639 here this 15 minute hey this one's not
00:05:49.120 hit but could we dive deeper into this
00:05:51.199 15-minute chart to see maybe there's a
00:05:53.440 smarter part of this 15-minute level or
00:05:55.280 just get maybe a little bit greedier
00:05:57.600 well if the 15-minute starts here and i
00:05:59.840 dive down into this chart here i can say
00:06:01.520 hey there's no test on this five-minute
00:06:03.039 level what about a three-minute this
00:06:04.639 three minutes relatively untested as
00:06:06.160 well what about a one minute well you
00:06:08.000 could even go as far as saying here's a
00:06:09.600 one minute untested level well okay
00:06:11.759 let's see if we were right or if we were
00:06:14.000 wrong on this
00:06:15.520 hit the auto button oh get us back up in
00:06:18.080 the charts let's move up in time frame
00:06:19.759 and let's see
00:06:21.840 there's that one-minute level here's our
00:06:23.600 original 15-minute level we can take
00:06:25.120 that 15-minute whole level off
00:06:27.039 find the one-minute level that will be
00:06:29.199 what holds the move down if we know
00:06:30.639 we're going to be breaking this move
00:06:31.840 down based on these hourly trends
00:06:33.680 because we're saying an hourly level can
00:06:35.039 attack the hourly trends this one was
00:06:36.880 already tested in the interior part of
00:06:39.120 the chart
00:06:40.160 you have the 15 minute level here gets
00:06:42.080 hit go down in time frames find the
00:06:43.600 whole level inside the 15 minute both
00:06:45.440 are tested in one fell swoop and bang
00:06:47.520 this is what could hold the move down if
00:06:49.520 you had missed this part of it you could
00:06:51.039 simply just go to the next hourly hold
00:06:52.880 level and you'd be right here and you
00:06:54.319 could see that got tested and you
00:06:55.840 probably can do the same trail and find
00:06:57.280 those levels inside of there and then
00:06:58.800 you can go to the next hourly hold level
00:07:00.560 and you can buy it there so here's what
00:07:02.639 you never want to do you never want to
00:07:05.120 buy a trend that's breaking like this
00:07:07.440 you never want this moment to happen and
00:07:09.199 your price is down here like this let's
00:07:10.800 use the replayer tool this is the
00:07:12.080 easiest way to do it actually you never
00:07:13.840 want to be going towards a trend and
00:07:15.520 trying to buy a trend breakout this is a
00:07:18.240 cardinal sin in trading it's the same
00:07:20.160 thing that happens here and unless you
00:07:22.080 know that you're going to break that
00:07:23.039 trend for other parts of your your chart
00:07:25.039 that are telling you hey we're breaking
00:07:26.319 this trend
00:07:27.599 don't buy trend breakouts they are a
00:07:29.280 recipe for disaster because this is what
00:07:30.960 will happen to you you'll try to buy a
00:07:32.560 trend breakout it looks like it's going
00:07:34.400 to be breaking the level you feel good
00:07:35.919 because you're up
00:07:37.039 a small amount of money or a small
00:07:38.479 percentage or if you're like me 100 x
00:07:39.919 trader you're up a decent amount of
00:07:41.520 money and then all of a sudden the trend
00:07:42.639 rejects and it just rips the other way
00:07:44.160 completely this is because you should
00:07:46.080 never be buying trend alternatively you
00:07:48.400 should be buying those moments that are
00:07:50.160 controlling the trend these moments up
00:07:51.759 here like this right where you have that
00:07:53.360 15 minute that i believe was reduced to
00:07:55.520 around here
00:07:56.879 as we look through the charts oh no
00:07:58.080 sorry it was a little higher it was it
00:07:59.120 was somewhere in here what it doesn't
00:08:00.639 matter we found where the level is we
00:08:02.080 can just pin it for here just for ease
00:08:03.520 of mind um we found where the level is
00:08:05.520 and that's what could hold this chart to
00:08:07.199 break that hourly level so whenever
00:08:09.120 you're whenever you're taking trades and
00:08:11.039 you're looking at trends look for the
00:08:12.720 hold levels that can break that trend
00:08:14.879 and a good indication is when you go and
00:08:17.599 you have a trend that starts like in
00:08:19.599 this case you had a four hour trend it
00:08:21.759 got diminished down to an hourly trend
00:08:23.840 and i believe it even works itself down
00:08:25.440 to a 15 minute trend if you go through
00:08:28.240 through these closes of this trend i
00:08:30.160 believe that once you get to the hourly
00:08:31.759 you can actually hard close it to
00:08:34.320 i believe if i remember correctly going
00:08:36.320 through this move it was right here so i
00:08:38.080 believe if you hard close this thing
00:08:39.279 properly you can even get down to a 15
00:08:40.799 minute telling you that on the other
00:08:42.320 side a 15 minute level is what's going
00:08:44.000 to hold it down that's going to break
00:08:45.279 the move because you're simply using the
00:08:47.120 same time frame that the trend exists to
00:08:48.959 break the move so that that way you're
00:08:50.399 going to have your buy spot your perfect
00:08:51.839 buy spot to attempt to break that trend
00:08:53.920 happen off of the hold level that's
00:08:55.680 holding it down so we can just hit play
00:08:57.279 here
00:08:58.720 let that
00:09:00.399 chart develop a bit you go to your 15
00:09:02.399 minute level and you can just find the
00:09:04.480 15 minute level that will break it down
00:09:06.240 which is right here which this is the
00:09:07.600 level that held and again you do that
00:09:09.440 same process of just going through this
00:09:10.959 and you can say hey here's a five minute
00:09:12.480 level and inside that five minute level
00:09:14.160 i'm sure there's a three minute level
00:09:15.360 and on a one minute level and and so
00:09:17.040 goes the story of hold levels within day
00:09:19.519 trading and how they attack and break
00:09:21.519 trends ah easy have it right here the
00:09:23.200 three minute level
00:09:24.640 perfect entry no risk and uh oops sorry
00:09:27.680 we need to go a little bit downward
00:09:28.959 perfect entry no risk you can see how
00:09:30.880 this had held the entirety of the move
00:09:32.240 down
00:09:33.200 and voila you can play a trend break by
00:09:35.760 identifying what can actually break the
00:09:37.680 trend time frame wise and then by
00:09:39.760 identifying that same component on the
00:09:42.160 other side of the chart to use hold
00:09:44.480 levels to buy a trend break so that you
00:09:46.959 can place your buys up in this range and
00:09:49.279 you can kind of just sit here and let
00:09:50.399 this thing ride down and break or if it
00:09:52.399 starts to break up on this side you can
00:09:53.760 get into your trade and profit still and
00:09:55.200 you've taken no risk because you
00:09:56.640 understand how to use trends properly
00:09:58.560 and you've understood how to use them
00:10:00.000 smartly by hard closing them from the
00:10:02.399 highest time frame down walking through
00:10:05.040 all of these interior points and we can
00:10:06.959 do it again real quick walking through
00:10:08.399 all of these interior points to get to a
00:10:10.000 15 minute moment right here uh which was
00:10:12.560 here which hard closes this guy right
00:10:15.120 here which then if you went to a 15
00:10:17.200 minute um
00:10:18.560 that's that same 15 minute level so
00:10:21.200 that's how you play trends this is the
00:10:22.880 right way to use trends we look for
00:10:24.800 trends to show us their strength by
00:10:26.880 saying i am developed on this time frame
00:10:28.720 therefore on the other side of the chart
00:10:30.320 that's what timeframe can hold me down i
00:10:32.079 can look for that level i can buy that
00:10:34.399 level and if it holds guess what you're
00:10:36.320 probably breaking the trend underneath
00:10:37.760 therefore granting you a great trend
00:10:39.680 trade see you on the next one

00:00:00.240 hi and welcome to my strategy series in
00:00:02.159 these videos we look at quick ways to
00:00:03.439 analyze the markets and in this video
00:00:05.120 we'll be looking at ladder points ladder
00:00:06.960 points are a pretty cool magical thing
00:00:08.800 on the charts if you were to go all the
00:00:10.400 way out to the biggest time frame on all
00:00:12.320 of the charts everything is laddering
00:00:14.080 back and forth between all time frames
00:00:15.759 for years on end things ladder and they
00:00:17.920 ladder back from the top of this point
00:00:19.600 to the bottom of this point and you
00:00:21.359 could go crazy looking at these ladder
00:00:23.119 points finding them for
00:00:24.960 50 60 70 years on some charts and to say
00:00:27.439 hey this thing has been laddering
00:00:28.720 forever but the cool thing about ladder
00:00:30.400 points is they act as a moment of
00:00:32.479 polarity you have to think of all charts
00:00:34.719 respecting the confines of trends so
00:00:37.520 above everything else trends and levels
00:00:39.600 are what respect the charts and give
00:00:41.520 them their parameters so if you were to
00:00:43.520 have a ladder point and and just let's
00:00:46.000 talk about ladder points and what a
00:00:47.200 ladder point actually means a ladder
00:00:48.320 point is something like imagine climbing
00:00:49.920 a ladder like if you were physically
00:00:52.239 climbing a ladder one step at a time up
00:00:54.399 or down that's exactly what a ladder
00:00:56.559 point on the charts is too it's where
00:00:58.079 you have
00:00:59.039 one moment here and it takes a small
00:01:00.719 step up over here and then it takes
00:01:02.239 another little ladder step up here and
00:01:04.000 it takes another one up here and this
00:01:05.600 can often be an indication of a level
00:01:08.159 that is holding
00:01:09.439 or a move that is about to happen in the
00:01:11.760 other direction so if you notice right
00:01:13.680 here you can see that you had the ladder
00:01:15.759 point previous from back here
00:01:17.920 and you have
00:01:19.280 the next one right here and if we zoom
00:01:20.960 in you can see it's ever so slightly
00:01:22.720 going up every single time this is
00:01:24.560 laddering its move laddered up there
00:01:26.320 ladder to here and it's having a
00:01:27.680 breaking moment up there because it's
00:01:29.600 breaking its opposing ladder which is
00:01:31.200 here to here to here and and so forth as
00:01:34.960 time goes on if you were to simply mark
00:01:37.280 out your trends you would have a better
00:01:39.680 distinction of what's actually happening
00:01:41.759 in these points so you could go
00:01:43.280 accumulation to accumulation on this
00:01:44.799 side right you first you'd be here
00:01:47.040 you would hard close that well you never
00:01:48.640 have a hard close and you notice how
00:01:50.079 that exact moment you break out of that
00:01:52.159 ladder point trend ladder points will
00:01:55.200 interact with trends in ways that show
00:01:57.360 you that something is either moving is
00:01:59.680 still in the same direction or it's
00:02:01.200 about to break down so in this case what
00:02:03.759 you'd want to do is you'd want to mark
00:02:05.360 out your ladder points on this side of
00:02:07.200 the chart and you could find some deep
00:02:09.598 possible great trades that exist in
00:02:11.760 there so you'd mark out this ladder
00:02:13.120 point if you continued we can continue
00:02:14.800 marking the trail of ladder points you
00:02:16.160 need to stay above this one now and we
00:02:18.080 can just take the replayer tool off
00:02:20.319 you can see that this trend broke and it
00:02:22.560 gave you the awesome ladder point that
00:02:25.280 it has to stay above so if you were to
00:02:27.120 go in here and find your whole levels
00:02:28.800 well you know that if this thing hits a
00:02:30.640 hold level
00:02:32.239 which in the previous video we went back
00:02:34.480 and we looked at this one here i believe
00:02:36.000 it was a five minute hold level is what
00:02:37.280 we settled on
00:02:38.959 uh maybe it was a 15 actually five
00:02:40.560 minute hold level uh i can't quite
00:02:42.319 remember as a five or fifteen not
00:02:43.840 important for right now but this ladder
00:02:45.680 point is respected as long as it stays
00:02:47.840 above this level we're going to mark the
00:02:49.840 15 just so we um we know we have a
00:02:51.599 property i have a little bit of a
00:02:52.800 inclination that it's the 15 also
00:02:54.319 because the trade missed so i'm pretty
00:02:55.599 sure what we did was the 15. so you are
00:02:58.239 looking at this trade now and you're
00:02:59.440 saying hey you're hitting a hold level
00:03:01.440 you're closing above this hold level hmm
00:03:04.080 this is pretty cool because now you have
00:03:05.680 a new hold level established right here
00:03:07.599 and you're laddering off of this move so
00:03:09.920 if you continue holding this right here
00:03:12.560 which is this whole level here and you
00:03:14.080 continue to hold this level above this
00:03:15.680 ladder point you've just established the
00:03:17.440 next ladder point and what happens with
00:03:19.200 a ladder point is after enough time has
00:03:21.120 passed a ladder point will eventually
00:03:23.120 break a trend you could do your trend
00:03:24.560 work work this thing down from the top
00:03:26.319 side so you'd end up being from this
00:03:28.319 point to this point here
00:03:30.159 like this which ends up just working its
00:03:32.319 way all the way down to something like
00:03:33.840 this as you work through your trends
00:03:34.959 you're going to be something along the
00:03:36.239 lines of accumulation to accumulation
00:03:38.239 like that and you can see your trend
00:03:39.840 that needs to break off of your ladder
00:03:41.599 point so accumulation ii
00:03:44.840 accumulation and we have a hard close
00:03:46.799 here we don't and this is the 15 minute
00:03:49.680 chart so we know if we hold this 15
00:03:51.280 minute level we can use this as a ladder
00:03:53.519 point entry in the trade to go and
00:03:55.599 attack this trend so the cool and
00:03:57.280 interesting thing about ladder points is
00:03:58.720 they're kind of two-fold as they can
00:04:00.480 validate and verify that something is
00:04:02.640 moving in the same direction same with
00:04:04.319 right here when you had that
00:04:05.439 three-minute hold level from the
00:04:06.560 previous video you had a ladder point
00:04:08.560 that looks like this top of the move
00:04:10.480 ladders from here to here to here to
00:04:12.959 here before it takes a huge fall off of
00:04:15.519 a cliff and what is this based on this
00:04:17.358 is based on a hold level so this is a
00:04:19.279 great way you can use your hold levels
00:04:21.759 and trends to assess hey are we in
00:04:24.000 success or failure if you were to take a
00:04:25.840 short tier for example you could take
00:04:27.919 the short on this first candle and say
00:04:30.240 are we laddering yes or no if we're
00:04:32.479 laddering and the answer is yes this is
00:04:35.040 great we've taken the short here and
00:04:36.720 we're laddering down it's about to break
00:04:38.800 the bottom side trend so it's about to
00:04:40.800 break whatever little local trend it has
00:04:42.880 so that local trend may be like this or
00:04:45.040 maybe even more aggressive like this it
00:04:46.880 would be kind of a range trend like this
00:04:49.199 and it hasn't closed yet so then you
00:04:51.360 maybe go to a different time frame i
00:04:52.960 think you end up with a five minute what
00:04:54.400 it looks like right here maybe
00:04:56.560 uh actually it's right here that's the
00:04:57.919 five minute candle so we can actually uh
00:04:59.680 go back here and make sure we mark the
00:05:01.520 right candles we'll walk through trends
00:05:02.720 again anyways so you don't have a hard
00:05:04.400 close here you can see the little tip of
00:05:05.919 the candle is still over it but you do
00:05:07.759 have one right here giving you trend
00:05:09.759 accuracy so you notice how it's
00:05:11.199 following this trend and if we are
00:05:13.840 following this trend and kind of moving
00:05:15.759 back and forth between these two levels
00:05:18.000 well we have this one broken down right
00:05:20.240 here so we can now move our trend to
00:05:21.919 there if you continuously ladder off of
00:05:25.039 this move
00:05:26.560 there's the first move even though it's
00:05:28.080 ever so slightly it is still laddering
00:05:30.000 down you've entered this trade this is
00:05:32.000 going to end up breaking your trend if
00:05:33.440 it continues to ladder so this can give
00:05:35.039 you great clarity and safety and a move
00:05:36.960 if you've entered a long or short and
00:05:38.960 you notice you have a trend that's
00:05:40.800 getting compressed against you and you
00:05:42.400 are laddering down against the move this
00:05:44.320 laddering can be a very key giveaway to
00:05:47.199 say hey this move is breaking and you're
00:05:49.759 on the right side of things
00:05:52.000 hasn't broken yet hits that ladder point
00:05:53.919 again this one hard closes oh it hasn't
00:05:56.240 hard closed yet but i think it's enough
00:05:58.160 there's the hard close and i'm just
00:05:59.440 gonna hit play here and it'll probably
00:06:00.800 fall off the face of the earth uh it
00:06:02.080 goes after one more ladder actually so
00:06:03.680 maybe there's one last final trend here
00:06:05.440 that it establishes uh this could
00:06:07.199 possibly be a larger timeframe trend 15
00:06:09.600 to 15.
00:06:11.759 oh come on trading views don't freeze on
00:06:13.280 us no not what we're recording
00:06:15.199 15 to 15 and it gives you your final
00:06:17.120 break point to get to your next trend so
00:06:18.960 just more trend play and uh the great
00:06:21.520 thing about laddering is it gives you a
00:06:24.000 lot of definition in a trade so if we
00:06:26.479 were to fast forward this trade right
00:06:27.759 now to the current space of where we're
00:06:29.360 at we can take the replayer tool off hit
00:06:31.360 the auto button we can see that if we
00:06:33.680 continue to hold this level and we
00:06:35.919 establish a moment where it's like okay
00:06:37.759 we've hit that level we went a little
00:06:39.199 deeper than expected but we hit it again
00:06:41.280 aha we're starting to ladder up and now
00:06:43.520 we just laddered this you're likely
00:06:44.880 going to have a breakout in this trend
00:06:47.039 so ladder points can be great clarifiers
00:06:49.759 and great votes of confidence of the
00:06:51.919 direction of something can go in and you
00:06:53.840 could even say in a chart if you wanted
00:06:56.319 to go really crazy and take some pretty
00:06:58.400 big risks you could then go one step
00:07:00.479 further and say hey as long as i don't
00:07:02.240 break this i could even ladder off this
00:07:04.479 part of the move and we're still kind of
00:07:05.840 technically an accumulation well this
00:07:07.520 would actually be true you technically
00:07:09.360 are still in accumulation even though
00:07:10.880 you broke your final hold level as long
00:07:12.800 as you stay above that ladder point
00:07:14.560 trends can still be created trends can
00:07:16.240 still be respected and it can give you
00:07:17.759 great clarity on your trades going
00:07:20.000 forward so if you were in this trade
00:07:21.520 right now what you'd look is you would
00:07:22.880 look to see this whole level hold and
00:07:24.479 you look to establish some type of
00:07:25.759 ladder points to confirm that hey my
00:07:27.520 whole level's still good and if you're
00:07:28.880 not creating the ladder points and
00:07:30.000 they're laddering in the opposite
00:07:31.120 direction against you well i think you
00:07:32.639 know what that means probably that the
00:07:34.319 trade is going to fail and break down
00:07:35.919 unless it's still holding a hold level
00:07:37.840 from the past see you on the next one

# Day Trade Strategy Series 4 Leverage & Spot
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/NRo8BEHgswE

00:00:00.240 hi and welcome to my strategy series in
00:00:02.080 these videos we look at quick ways to
00:00:03.439 analyze the markets in this video we're
00:00:05.200 going to be looking at when to spot
00:00:06.480 trade when to increase your leverage and
00:00:08.000 go to margin trading and when to use big
00:00:09.519 leverage as a futures trader okay let's
00:00:11.840 talk about spot margin and future
00:00:13.440 trading where you should be and how to
00:00:15.280 get to the other stages so this is going
00:00:17.680 to be mostly theory we're going to be
00:00:18.880 talking more than doing levels and
00:00:20.160 marking charts so i'm simply going to
00:00:21.840 continue on with the series we marked
00:00:23.519 the ladders here and we've marked a
00:00:25.199 trend up here i'm simply going to
00:00:26.320 continue on as we watch this with just
00:00:29.039 by marking out this blue to blue candle
00:00:30.880 as the active trend again when we talk
00:00:33.120 about trends we don't have enough data
00:00:35.520 on the daily to mark anything
00:00:38.079 we could use the bottom of this but we
00:00:39.440 have a four-hour interior range that we
00:00:41.520 are more likely to be using than that
00:00:43.920 larger trend that would be the daily
00:00:46.079 from down here
00:00:47.520 to a point like this feel free to use it
00:00:49.360 but it really isn't going to be as
00:00:50.640 accurate as this trend here you need
00:00:52.239 this thing to come down one more time
00:00:53.600 break this range right here in order to
00:00:55.360 use a daily to daily trend like that so
00:00:57.520 with that said
00:00:58.800 trend accuracy remember
00:01:00.879 distribution to distribution candle well
00:01:02.800 it may not look right i guarantee you
00:01:04.159 this will be right going forward and if
00:01:05.600 you really are
00:01:06.799 trying to stay above this thing you
00:01:08.320 could you could go and go to smaller
00:01:09.920 time frames and see if it hard closed
00:01:11.280 breaks but i think it's a little too
00:01:12.880 premature to be doing that so let's talk
00:01:15.520 about spot trading position uh spot
00:01:17.759 trading margin and futures trading
00:01:20.159 we left off and we're going to watch
00:01:21.840 this we left off with with trends and
00:01:23.600 kind of a prediction of what's going to
00:01:24.640 happen next so people who spot trade the
00:01:27.439 thing that they should be doing is is
00:01:29.520 spot training is when you're a brand new
00:01:31.680 trader it's very safe it's quite hard to
00:01:34.320 lose money spot trading because you're
00:01:35.600 not taking a lot of risk and really
00:01:37.200 you're trying to find these points in
00:01:39.439 the charts that are the final moments so
00:01:42.479 for example if you were going to hold
00:01:44.000 all of these ladder points you were
00:01:45.680 going to hold this one which is
00:01:46.720 represented here and you have to now
00:01:48.560 hold this one which is represented by
00:01:50.159 the level here you know that if you
00:01:52.000 start to break this trend and break down
00:01:53.439 a little bit below this level here
00:01:55.040 you're you're gonna lose a lot of money
00:01:56.560 because this thing is probably dumping
00:01:57.680 down to a much crazier range and like i
00:01:59.360 would assume that after it loses this
00:02:01.520 level here if it does lose this level
00:02:03.520 you're breaking down either way down
00:02:05.759 here somewhere to one of these two
00:02:07.119 ranges or to the bottom of this move to
00:02:08.878 see if it can test to hold it up so
00:02:10.479 after this first little
00:02:12.319 point two four percent is lost
00:02:14.400 you're scaling all the way down like
00:02:16.160 another two and a half two point seven
00:02:18.080 five percent here so you're scaling all
00:02:19.599 the way down to three percent and five
00:02:21.280 percent and even lower into this uh to
00:02:23.120 the 10 mark so there's not much to be
00:02:26.640 gained by staying in a failing trade
00:02:28.400 here if you've taken along and it and it
00:02:30.480 starts to fail below that quarter of a
00:02:32.160 percent that's where you just get out of
00:02:33.760 your trade and for spot trading you
00:02:35.680 really can't lose that much money spot
00:02:37.840 trading for this reason because you're
00:02:38.800 losing a quarter of a percent regardless
00:02:40.640 of the amount of money a quarter of a
00:02:41.760 percent is is still
00:02:43.519 small given the size of the entire
00:02:45.440 holdings so you don't sit here and say
00:02:47.440 oh a quarter percent of 100 million
00:02:48.959 dollars well of course but still small
00:02:50.400 relative to the size of 100 million
00:02:52.400 dollars so relative to the size of the
00:02:54.080 whole things a quarter of a percent is
00:02:55.280 very safe so if you notice your accuracy
00:02:58.239 is low in the charts and you're having
00:03:00.319 troubles finding these greedier and more
00:03:03.120 kind of final moments these moments of
00:03:05.120 polarity these these final things that
00:03:06.800 can hold up the entirety of the chart
00:03:08.239 but you would want to be more of a spot
00:03:10.080 trader because you're going to be
00:03:11.360 diminishing the amount of money that
00:03:12.959 you're losing down to a smaller amount
00:03:15.360 and you have a bigger room of error to
00:03:18.080 say maybe you marked this as a four hour
00:03:20.480 level so let's go mark this four hour
00:03:22.159 level oh there is no four hour level in
00:03:23.760 here actually what about like an hourly
00:03:25.680 level is there an hourly level do we
00:03:27.040 have anything there um you have
00:03:29.040 something inside of here the hourly
00:03:31.200 level right here so maybe you marked
00:03:32.879 this and not realizing that you could
00:03:34.799 ladder all the way down to this part of
00:03:36.239 the move because it's the next thing
00:03:37.440 that laddered off the test of these
00:03:38.799 levels so you may not know and this just
00:03:41.360 draws back to the 15 minute levels if we
00:03:43.200 need to uh to go through this again real
00:03:44.959 quick this just draws back to your 15
00:03:47.120 minute level or you had a 15 minute
00:03:48.400 level there that was tested and your
00:03:50.239 next one was right here which was tested
00:03:52.159 and your next one was right here and and
00:03:53.680 this would i believe this is what got
00:03:55.439 tested at the moment and it did so so
00:03:57.680 this range the entirety of the range of
00:03:59.920 all the 15 minute candles and specific
00:04:01.920 in this moment to 15. it's not always
00:04:03.120 going to be a rule that is 15 minute
00:04:04.720 candles these ones had already been
00:04:06.159 tested so therefore your next part of
00:04:08.319 this move is down here so if you
00:04:10.959 wouldn't have seen that and didn't
00:04:12.400 realize that well you might have marked
00:04:14.239 the hourly level and said hey it's
00:04:16.320 supposed to be here it's the whole level
00:04:17.839 i'm supposed to go after and then maybe
00:04:19.279 you miss the fact that it actually
00:04:20.560 tested right here hey this actually
00:04:22.400 tested this hourly whole level so it's
00:04:23.759 likely not going to hold this it's
00:04:25.280 likely going to say we've tested this
00:04:26.880 range let's go down here to this range
00:04:28.800 which is exactly what you're seeing
00:04:29.759 right now it's trying to create a ladder
00:04:30.880 off this range so this is where spot
00:04:32.479 trading is good if your accuracy is low
00:04:35.120 spot trading becomes
00:04:36.800 the right thing to do until you can
00:04:38.720 increase your accuracy until you've just
00:04:40.080 had enough charts and enough trades that
00:04:42.560 you can say hey i understand these
00:04:43.520 ladder points i understand the triggers
00:04:44.800 i understand trends and hold levels and
00:04:46.560 you've gone through my courses and
00:04:47.600 you've been able to scale up in size
00:04:50.639 that's where you can say okay
00:04:53.759 now that i've done my accuracy checks i
00:04:57.040 i'm pretty confident in what i'm doing
00:04:58.479 i'm getting really good trades you can
00:05:00.080 then move into being more of a margin
00:05:02.320 trader margin is slight leverage and
00:05:04.080 what margin means is you're using a
00:05:05.759 contract you're using a multiplier so if
00:05:08.320 you had a hundred dollars on a trade and
00:05:10.560 you did say 5x well making 100 would net
00:05:14.160 you five percent so if bitcoin doubled
00:05:16.080 in price on a 5x contract um a margin of
00:05:19.120 five times again this is a multiplier so
00:05:21.199 if bitcoin doubled right now and and you
00:05:22.960 had a hundred dollars on a 5x contract
00:05:25.360 well if you were on spot you would make
00:05:26.800 200 or sorry you'd profit 100 your total
00:05:29.199 position the cell size would be 200 you
00:05:31.680 would therefore have made 100
00:05:34.160 if you're a margin trader and you use 5x
00:05:36.720 which is 500 of the games you would have
00:05:39.039 a 500 leftover afterwards instead of 100
00:05:42.800 or 200 depending on 100 starting size
00:05:45.039 200 was what you would make on spot if
00:05:47.120 you went to 5x you'd make 500
00:05:49.919 but you also lose it just as fast so
00:05:52.400 what happens is that 5x you're also
00:05:55.199 multiplying it on the other side so
00:05:57.199 instead of
00:05:58.240 having to lose if you were to lose that
00:05:59.600 same hundred dollars bitcoin would
00:06:01.199 essentially have to go to zero if you
00:06:02.639 were just on spot because one bitcoin is
00:06:04.479 worth whatever it's worth but if you
00:06:06.000 were on 5x you would only have to lose
00:06:08.800 20 percent of the price in order to
00:06:10.880 liquidate that position now there's
00:06:12.800 calculations and fees and different
00:06:14.400 things we're just using easy round
00:06:15.600 numbers so people can understand the
00:06:16.800 theory i know don't don't uh go too
00:06:18.960 crazy with oh what about fees what about
00:06:20.560 this i'm well aware of the fees and
00:06:21.759 those things but we're just using easy
00:06:23.039 numbers to uh to kind of prove a point
00:06:25.039 and sell a message here
00:06:27.840 you will only be at a spot where
00:06:30.960 twenty percent of the price of bitcoin
00:06:32.319 goes down you've lost that hundred
00:06:33.440 dollars it liquidates your position and
00:06:35.039 takes that money so when you're trading
00:06:37.680 spot
00:06:39.199 it's it's it's kind of like okay i can
00:06:41.039 trade spot and uh
00:06:43.440 this is more of like an investment thing
00:06:45.520 in in some circles you can say hey spot
00:06:48.000 trading is great for long-term
00:06:49.280 investments because you don't have to
00:06:50.319 manage them and worry about it going up
00:06:52.319 or down too much just because over time
00:06:53.840 spot trading now really makes sense for
00:06:55.520 investments you can sell margin or
00:06:57.120 futures trade
00:06:58.479 investments you just have to be a little
00:06:59.840 more attentive to the positions but as
00:07:01.680 your accuracy increases you're going to
00:07:03.599 want to go and you're going to want to
00:07:04.880 try to increase your leverage into maybe
00:07:06.639 5x or 10x or even 20 20 20x is getting a
00:07:09.360 little high that's starting to get the
00:07:10.800 derivative side of things which is
00:07:12.560 futures which is high leverage high
00:07:14.240 gains high margin small room for error
00:07:16.880 so you're going to base all of this on
00:07:18.720 how accurate of a trader you are and
00:07:20.560 then when you go into futures trading
00:07:22.160 which is anywhere from i believe the
00:07:23.759 definition from futures is 25x i believe
00:07:26.160 you can still technically be trading
00:07:27.759 margin under 20x
00:07:29.680 don't know the exact line i'm 100x
00:07:31.599 trader i just do 100x
00:07:33.840 don't know the exact line between if
00:07:36.000 it's 20 or 15 or 25 but somewhere in
00:07:38.319 there lies the hard definition of and i
00:07:40.479 believe it's 25
00:07:42.160 sorry 25x that's the hard definition of
00:07:45.280 being a futures trader so you can
00:07:46.560 increase your leverage even then further
00:07:48.479 but you've got to be like on the spot
00:07:50.240 accurate because in this trade if you
00:07:51.840 were to buy this level on 100x i think
00:07:53.759 this is like a liquidation here uh it's
00:07:55.919 really close you lose you're close your
00:07:57.919 liquidation is around after fees and
00:07:59.919 everything around 0.6 and change it it
00:08:03.120 varies based on
00:08:04.879 the different fees in the market maker
00:08:06.319 fees taker fees how you've executed
00:08:08.160 trade market limit there's there's a lot
00:08:09.520 of variables it factors on but if you
00:08:10.960 were in say a 100x trade right and you
00:08:14.319 went and you said you wanted to long
00:08:15.919 this spot you would have almost lost all
00:08:17.599 your money it almost gets to that point
00:08:19.199 where you've lost it all uh you're close
00:08:21.520 so your accuracy must be laser straight
00:08:23.919 you must be nailing trays to the doll or
00:08:26.240 two dollars five dollars ten dollars you
00:08:28.160 must be nailing them to start becoming a
00:08:29.759 derivatives trader and a futures trader
00:08:31.840 so again the way you scale this and the
00:08:33.360 way you surmise what makes sense for you
00:08:35.760 and how you fit into this and what
00:08:37.360 should i spot trade or should i margin
00:08:38.719 trade should i futures trade the way you
00:08:40.399 do that is you do it by checking your
00:08:42.159 accuracy and you do it by seeing how
00:08:44.480 close to the price can i get
00:08:47.279 before it actually moves in the other
00:08:48.880 direction so to understand this properly
00:08:51.600 you just have to take a bunch of trades
00:08:53.279 and you just have to continuously do
00:08:54.880 accuracy checking on yourself and say
00:08:56.320 hey most of the time i'm getting really
00:08:58.399 close maybe i should up my leverage a
00:08:59.760 bit and try it and don't go off the deep
00:09:01.839 end from zero to 100 100 x is the pro
00:09:04.320 leagues i may do it but this is also
00:09:06.399 like the highest level of trading there
00:09:08.080 is this is the extreme pro leagues this
00:09:10.240 is this is only for the best of the best
00:09:12.160 in the world so you know you can make a
00:09:13.680 great income off spot trading you can
00:09:15.120 make an insanely good income off margin
00:09:17.279 trading futures trading is you know even
00:09:19.360 better of course but then at the same
00:09:21.279 time it's only for the the most
00:09:23.920 high-level professionals in the world so
00:09:25.920 be careful with futures trading and
00:09:27.600 that's a good way i like to teach people
00:09:29.680 how to gauge how they should spot margin
00:09:32.320 or futures derivatives trade is based on
00:09:35.360 the accuracy of how they catch moves
00:09:38.160 on the next one

# Day Trade Strategy Series 5 Longs & Shorts
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/Pp5Wsl1ln3w

00:00:00.160 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.000 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.600 the markets in this video we're going to
00:00:04.880 be looking at when to short and when too
00:00:06.480 long so i've gone ahead and removed all
00:00:08.880 the levels from the past videos just to
00:00:10.160 clean up our charts a bit and i've
00:00:11.599 marked out what could be the range
00:00:13.519 inside of this chart so back here we
00:00:16.480 last left off with a 15 minute level
00:00:18.080 that was getting held and we're gonna
00:00:19.600 remark that just so people who haven't
00:00:21.600 seen the past video have been able to
00:00:23.439 keep up i've changed the color to pink
00:00:25.119 just to represent what could be the very
00:00:26.720 bottom of this move or the bottom of the
00:00:28.480 range so whenever you're identifying
00:00:30.320 whether you should be doing longs or
00:00:32.000 short you should look at the overarching
00:00:33.920 picture on the higher time frames and
00:00:35.600 you should define a range of
00:00:37.600 possibilities so kind of the maximum
00:00:40.160 point it could go before breaking into
00:00:41.840 the next part of the move for example up
00:00:44.160 here this would be the very top of the
00:00:45.680 daily range this distribution candle
00:00:47.600 here led to this big dump so if you were
00:00:49.840 going to break this level while the next
00:00:51.520 likely level you'd go after is all the
00:00:53.120 way up here you would probably break
00:00:55.120 this daily level and all these levels
00:00:57.039 that hit it had been fighting now that
00:00:58.879 this is the final piece of the move it
00:01:00.239 would likely break up to the next
00:01:01.840 untested region which is up here so
00:01:04.479 between this and this this lies a large
00:01:06.960 gap in the trade therefore making this
00:01:08.960 kind of the final moment if you were to
00:01:11.280 say hey this is the very bottom it needs
00:01:13.360 to come all the way up here you've
00:01:14.880 defined
00:01:16.240 while this may be pretty big you've
00:01:18.080 defined kind of the area and then you
00:01:19.759 can work time frame down and say hey
00:01:21.600 anything on the four hour no it's very
00:01:23.439 much the same thing on the four hour
00:01:25.439 rather you would start marking out your
00:01:26.799 hold levels
00:01:28.000 and then you'd go to the one hour and
00:01:29.520 you can say hey is there anything on the
00:01:30.720 one hour and you actually do you have
00:01:32.079 the next part of the move that would
00:01:33.360 give you where you're going and what
00:01:35.600 might end up being a great short target
00:01:38.320 so if you were longing you'd want to be
00:01:40.079 longing right now for the reasons we
00:01:41.520 spoke about in the previous videos
00:01:42.960 you've already tested your level back
00:01:44.240 here you've had to move down you've hit
00:01:46.880 your hold levels and laddered the move
00:01:48.399 so you've created a ladder from here to
00:01:51.040 here
00:01:51.920 to here and now you're creating this
00:01:53.680 next piece of the ladder which is right
00:01:55.040 here and that got created off of hitting
00:01:56.560 this whole level well this would be a
00:01:57.840 great place to long because it's very
00:01:59.439 much the bottom of the move you don't
00:02:01.920 really have any hole levels left
00:02:03.280 underneath it that are continuing to
00:02:04.560 hold up this move rather than it going
00:02:06.640 and back attacking something like a
00:02:08.080 reverse level and if you've watched
00:02:09.520 butterfly effect you know what a reverse
00:02:11.200 level is if you haven't a quick tl dr is
00:02:13.680 it's a level that was wicked through in
00:02:14.959 the past and can act as support in the
00:02:16.319 future to latter the next part of the
00:02:17.840 move by logic if you went through the
00:02:19.840 level you could just go back and retest
00:02:21.599 it creating the next ladder point which
00:02:23.040 would give you a trend so just a quick
00:02:25.200 tldr what a reverse level is go through
00:02:27.040 a level you can attack it again in the
00:02:28.400 future because it can still create trend
00:02:29.840 off of that level
00:02:31.360 and latter points
00:02:32.879 so in this trade when we're looking at
00:02:34.720 this we've got the perfect candidate for
00:02:37.440 along we've got a trend that was just
00:02:39.519 created we've got a whole level that's
00:02:41.760 being hit at the very bottom of that
00:02:43.760 we're rate just slightly hovering above
00:02:46.959 the actual ladder point so it's kind of
00:02:48.720 using a combination of all of these
00:02:50.480 things to say hey this is a great long
00:02:53.120 you would never short this level though
00:02:54.800 you would never go into these charts and
00:02:56.400 say hey this could break the move let me
00:02:59.040 short this level once it starts breaking
00:03:00.720 because the simple fact is that what
00:03:02.480 happens when you short a level like this
00:03:04.560 is that you may be here on a 15 minute
00:03:06.720 time frame and you have a 15 minute hold
00:03:09.120 and you may try to short this level
00:03:10.400 because it looks like it's breaking on a
00:03:11.760 really small time frame you're sitting
00:03:12.959 here and you're like oh my god you know
00:03:14.239 this level's hard closing on the five
00:03:15.680 minute chart and it's breaking down but
00:03:18.000 the simple fact is that it still has
00:03:20.080 larger time frames that it can stay
00:03:21.440 above what may look like breaking down
00:03:23.360 on the five minute actually doesn't hard
00:03:25.440 close on the 15 and then just creates
00:03:27.280 the next perfect candidate for your next
00:03:29.519 ladder point in this trade you would
00:03:31.280 just simply have this as a hold level
00:03:33.120 going forward in the future you can
00:03:34.560 delete this because this one was already
00:03:35.920 held and therefore gives you the next
00:03:37.599 great opportunity for a long position
00:03:39.519 and if this breaks then you're likely
00:03:41.519 going to move down
00:03:42.799 rather instead of trying to short this
00:03:44.720 move because i know a lot of people have
00:03:46.239 this strategy where they say hey i'm
00:03:48.000 going to long here and when it starts to
00:03:49.599 break let me short you will always get
00:03:51.680 into a mess by doing that for this exact
00:03:53.519 reason it moves down you've longed it
00:03:55.200 you exit along you open a short because
00:03:56.799 you think it's breaking down the short
00:03:58.560 ends up going the opposite way goes back
00:04:00.400 long you weren't along you close your
00:04:02.080 shoulder you take the loss and then it
00:04:03.599 just becomes a big mess you're just
00:04:05.120 constantly bleeding profits on guessing
00:04:06.879 trades
00:04:07.760 instead couldn't you just go to the
00:04:09.439 opposite level and say hey here's the
00:04:11.680 whole level on the other side do the
00:04:13.120 inverse hole level we'll talk about
00:04:14.319 inverses in the future but the opposing
00:04:15.920 hold level and you'd want to short that
00:04:17.918 if you think this is going to break down
00:04:19.918 here so you're never going to short
00:04:21.358 something that acts as long support even
00:04:24.479 if it's breaking down you're going to
00:04:25.759 wait for it to go and test that moment
00:04:27.440 where this can hold it down and it can
00:04:29.440 just break it from there reducing your
00:04:31.440 risk down to zero so when you're looking
00:04:32.960 for these quick analyzes in the markets
00:04:34.639 and you're looking for these quick
00:04:35.680 tricks you should long when you have a
00:04:37.600 combination of things working together
00:04:39.040 when you have trends hold levels and
00:04:40.400 ladder points all working together at
00:04:41.840 the same time they become very safe
00:04:43.280 targets that are highly controllable and
00:04:45.280 they're going to break down much further
00:04:47.840 they're going to give you a way earlier
00:04:49.360 sign that they're breaking down
00:04:50.479 something like this where it hits a
00:04:51.919 inverse level and it's saying hey i
00:04:53.199 can't regain my move up and i'm still
00:04:55.440 moving down off these inverse levels and
00:04:57.440 the alternative would be true on the
00:04:58.800 other side when you're looking for short
00:05:00.320 targets you should look for parts of
00:05:02.000 these moves that can continuously hold
00:05:04.400 it down so a good example of that would
00:05:06.560 be if i were to draw this on my chart i
00:05:08.160 could say hey here's a level here but i
00:05:10.880 actually think it's only going to reach
00:05:12.479 this right here because maybe there's
00:05:14.720 like a five minute level here let's go
00:05:16.560 and check
00:05:18.160 okay so this was actually already tested
00:05:20.080 as a five minute level so perfect we
00:05:21.600 already have a tested part of this move
00:05:24.240 this was
00:05:26.160 kind of not tested which also falls
00:05:28.320 under this right here and then you have
00:05:29.600 this right here so i would mark both of
00:05:30.960 these levels and say okay well let's go
00:05:32.960 take a look at what could actually be a
00:05:34.160 trade because this right here could be
00:05:35.759 the level and it's kind of the same
00:05:37.199 thing as this so if we go back to our
00:05:39.199 hourly chart we now see a spot where
00:05:42.960 if you were to simply move up in this
00:05:44.479 trade let's get this off
00:05:46.960 oh and see actually this was the perfect
00:05:48.800 spot to actually take that trade and it
00:05:50.639 acts as the trend probably from back
00:05:54.080 here now that i've seen this i actually
00:05:55.440 hadn't seen this one prior but this is
00:05:56.880 great because it actually acts as your
00:05:58.160 trend from back here on the chart so now
00:06:00.720 you have a trend from here and then you
00:06:03.039 have your further trend moving in the
00:06:04.880 future like this so you have that then
00:06:06.880 you have this architecture here and
00:06:08.240 you're starting to build the
00:06:08.960 architecture of your chart so like a
00:06:10.639 really cool thing that you could do now
00:06:12.240 is you have no four-hour candles so
00:06:14.479 that's great so you can you only have to
00:06:16.000 worry about using your hourly candle
00:06:17.600 here so now you could say well
00:06:20.400 if we go up here
00:06:22.560 let's get that brush tool back if we go
00:06:24.720 up here we now have a great target which
00:06:27.280 is this this acts as a great short
00:06:29.199 target instead of trying to wait for
00:06:32.080 where you should short after this trend
00:06:33.600 is breaking the problem with shorting
00:06:34.880 this level is it's already breaking the
00:06:36.319 trend so unless there's some kind of
00:06:37.919 major rejection you're just going to get
00:06:39.840 yourself into trouble on this trade
00:06:40.960 because what's going to happen is like
00:06:41.919 this imagine this trade comes all the
00:06:43.440 way out here it hits trend and this
00:06:45.440 trend either has to pull it back or it
00:06:46.880 has to move it forward so this trend is
00:06:48.319 going to move it forward it's going to
00:06:49.599 hit this level and pull back the problem
00:06:51.599 is is your heart closing over top of
00:06:53.039 this trend confirming that you're
00:06:54.160 breaking out of the trend so what's
00:06:55.360 going to happen is you're going to hit
00:06:56.639 this level that's developed off the back
00:06:58.400 side there you're going to bounce off
00:07:00.000 this level and what may seem like a
00:07:02.319 great short target as you're about to
00:07:03.919 fail trend actually just sits long
00:07:05.680 enough above it and it confirms like a
00:07:07.280 one or a four hour hard close and then
00:07:08.720 moves up like in in a crazy quick way so
00:07:11.039 then you have a very nice easy and clear
00:07:13.039 way to say hey here's a trend here's my
00:07:16.160 range this is what i should be doing i
00:07:17.919 should be logging down here because it's
00:07:19.919 combining all these theories and then
00:07:21.759 you should find the same thing on this
00:07:22.960 side of the chart and you should say
00:07:24.160 well where's a level that hasn't been
00:07:25.599 tested yet that stays below this trend
00:07:28.479 well it's not this one that's already
00:07:30.240 tested and it's not this one that's
00:07:31.680 already tested so maybe we should move
00:07:33.280 down in time frames and see
00:07:34.960 hey is there anything else here
00:07:37.199 let's take a look
00:07:39.120 15 minute nope
00:07:42.000 this one could act as a reverse level
00:07:43.599 but i don't feel comfortable with that
00:07:45.039 let's keep it simple for this example
00:07:46.479 what about a five minute
00:07:48.160 do we have anything up here in the
00:07:49.199 higher parts of this move that are a
00:07:50.479 five minute that are untested
00:07:52.479 this one's tested
00:07:54.080 this one's not so what about this so if
00:07:56.560 you were to go back into a larger time
00:07:58.160 frame and just kind of zoom out
00:08:00.639 well what would happen if you came to
00:08:02.879 this chart all the way out here and you
00:08:04.639 came to this moment here and you said
00:08:06.400 hey here's my level and here's my trend
00:08:08.400 working together in unison well this
00:08:09.840 would make for a great short target and
00:08:11.919 if you wanted to relong it you'd wait
00:08:13.599 till this rejects it holds some kind of
00:08:15.599 level that it developed back here right
00:08:17.520 here and then you could either long here
00:08:19.919 or short here but you would never long
00:08:22.400 the breaking of this trend you would be
00:08:24.160 longing what's attacking that trend
00:08:25.840 before it happens so this is a great way
00:08:27.759 to look at where i should where you
00:08:29.280 should short and where you should long
00:08:31.039 you should find the points and moments
00:08:33.440 that control the larger hierarchies of
00:08:35.839 the chart the larger meta of what's
00:08:37.760 happening in the market and you should
00:08:39.200 find the levels that combine with other
00:08:41.120 theories to ultimately give it more
00:08:42.799 strength trend mixed with a whole level
00:08:44.560 and latter points well i wonder could
00:08:46.640 that not just then say hey i ladder from
00:08:48.720 here to here to here to here and now to
00:08:52.320 here yes it could so this would
00:08:53.839 essentially be the exact same thing and
00:08:55.519 you would have almost a perfect trade by
00:08:57.680 saying hey i've got a whole level that's
00:08:59.200 untested i've got a trend that it's
00:09:01.120 close enough to this whole level that
00:09:02.160 they can both support the move up and
00:09:04.480 i've got a ladder point which can now
00:09:06.240 confirm three things that would actually
00:09:08.000 hold this move down and then you've got
00:09:09.920 a great short opportunity and on the
00:09:11.680 opposite side a great long opportunity
00:09:13.200 on the bottom see on the next one cheers

# Day Trade Strategy Series 6 Inverse Levels
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/6GS8ht1p1Po

00:00:00.240 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.240 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.919 the markets in this video we're going to
00:00:05.600 be talking about how to use an inverse
00:00:07.279 level so the term inversion means the
00:00:09.120 opposite side of the chart so when you
00:00:10.719 say inverse levels or an inverse trend
00:00:13.200 or anything with the word inverse in it
00:00:15.440 it just simply means that it's on the
00:00:17.279 other side of the trend so for example
00:00:20.000 an inverse level here would be the
00:00:21.760 hourly inverse so if you were referring
00:00:24.080 to hey this just held an hourly level
00:00:27.680 and it's going after the hourly inverse
00:00:29.760 it would be the inverse level or the
00:00:32.399 level of inversion so we're going to
00:00:34.239 just move this back to here to our
00:00:35.520 15-minute level and if we were to mark a
00:00:37.840 15-minute inverse level well it would be
00:00:40.160 one in the same level here would be the
00:00:41.840 hourly and the same price is actually
00:00:43.840 the 15 minute level the next inverse
00:00:46.320 level would be up here and then the next
00:00:49.360 one would be here which is already
00:00:50.559 tested so this is kind of the untested
00:00:52.719 in first level of the move on the 15
00:00:55.760 minute time frame now inverse levels are
00:00:58.719 great because
00:01:00.239 they give you kind of this very clear
00:01:03.440 level to see where shorts can happen now
00:01:06.960 this of course is the exact same thing
00:01:08.400 as a whole level on the bottom side
00:01:09.680 because it's just an inverse hold level
00:01:11.360 after all and inverse just means it's
00:01:13.439 the opposite side so technical so
00:01:15.360 technically if you were to say i'm going
00:01:16.880 to shorter target the inversion to the
00:01:18.880 short would be the long and then the
00:01:20.240 inversion to the long would be the short
00:01:21.920 so when we refer to inverse levels we
00:01:24.240 are just referring to the opposing side
00:01:26.560 this can be the same thing for trends
00:01:28.400 it's the same thing for ladder points
00:01:29.920 inverse ladder point well we're going to
00:01:31.200 go from one ladder point to the inverse
00:01:33.119 ladder point and i think that's where a
00:01:35.680 smart strategy lies is whenever you're
00:01:38.400 targeting a level you should think of
00:01:41.439 what the inverse to that same target is
00:01:44.320 so for example if you were going to buy
00:01:46.159 a ladder point on this side well that
00:01:48.240 ladder point has to be strong enough to
00:01:50.240 hold it up so you're probably going to
00:01:52.240 go to the ladder point on the side that
00:01:54.240 brought it there and that ladder point
00:01:55.759 would be either from here or here in my
00:01:58.719 opinion it's going to be this red one
00:02:00.479 right here for reasons that we talked
00:02:01.840 about in the other videos but we can't
00:02:03.520 see exactly what it's going to go after
00:02:04.960 until we have a little bit more
00:02:06.000 information on our charts it would be a
00:02:07.680 little too premature to say that
00:02:11.280 to say it's going after that level for
00:02:12.720 sure we're not sure but moving on a
00:02:14.879 really good strategy is whatever point
00:02:17.360 you go after assume that it's going to
00:02:19.520 go after the inverse to that moment so
00:02:22.400 if you were to go for the the latter
00:02:24.000 point up here the inversion would have
00:02:25.840 been the latter point down here and
00:02:28.160 that's exactly what happens you have
00:02:29.680 this ladder point collapses you have
00:02:31.519 this ladders one two three four five
00:02:33.200 times and goes after the in first ladder
00:02:35.519 point that brought that move up so if
00:02:38.080 you take this move back to here if
00:02:39.599 you're going to go to the very top of
00:02:41.120 the move well you'd probably attack the
00:02:43.440 inverse part of that move in the very
00:02:45.280 bottom because if you went to the very
00:02:46.640 top which is right here well you're
00:02:48.160 likely going to just go and go back
00:02:50.480 attack whatever inverse level is here
00:02:52.959 so if we hit play
00:02:55.920 you can see it did exactly that and it
00:02:58.239 attacks the inverse level on the chart
00:03:01.360 and then if you were to say well okay
00:03:03.280 we're going to go to that inversion up
00:03:05.519 top and we found that level earlier in
00:03:07.680 the series then you're going to go down
00:03:09.599 to this inversion point down below and
00:03:12.159 voila you do you go down to the
00:03:13.760 inversion point below and once you fail
00:03:16.080 this inversion point it's kind of like
00:03:17.840 hold levels
00:03:19.680 breaking through and
00:03:21.840 you have one whole level and it trails
00:03:23.120 into another hold level into a third and
00:03:24.640 a fourth hold level builds up this
00:03:26.000 architecture and once the top pin falls
00:03:28.560 it's kind of like everything goes below
00:03:30.400 it as well once the head pin falls just
00:03:32.239 like in a bowling arena then all the
00:03:34.640 other pins behind it usually go too so
00:03:37.760 it's kind of the same thing if you've
00:03:38.879 hit the top of a move you're going to
00:03:40.319 say hey let's go to the inversion point
00:03:42.239 on the opposing side so we can use this
00:03:44.560 for ladder points as to where ladder
00:03:45.920 points go after ladder points because
00:03:48.239 moments go after their inversion moments
00:03:50.159 and we can use this for trends well
00:03:52.000 trends compress against each other so
00:03:53.599 this is also true so if we have a trend
00:03:56.319 then hey it's probably going to go to
00:03:57.599 the inversion trend that is the same
00:03:59.280 trend as it just on the opposite side of
00:04:00.959 the chart and then same with the hold
00:04:02.319 levels from four hour to four hour to
00:04:04.000 one to one hour 15 minutes 15 minute and
00:04:06.239 so forth
00:04:07.519 inversion is awesome because it gives
00:04:10.000 you very clear targets on the opposite
00:04:12.000 side of the chart as what you should go
00:04:13.519 after we just hit a 15 minute hole level
00:04:16.399 we've got a trend that we're holding
00:04:18.399 we've uh hit the ladder point well we're
00:04:20.320 probably going to go attack all those
00:04:21.600 same great things on the top side so it
00:04:23.520 gives you great targets for whenever
00:04:24.800 you're in along great targets forever
00:04:26.639 you're ever in a short and very
00:04:28.880 clear direction of what the next
00:04:31.440 target's going to be and where we're
00:04:33.040 going next in the charts so see you on
00:04:34.560 the next one

00:00:00.080 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.000 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.760 the markets in this video we're going to
00:00:05.520 be talking about local global and legacy
00:00:07.600 trends okay let's talk about trends
00:00:10.320 specifically local global legacy if you
00:00:12.080 don't know exactly what those terms mean
00:00:13.679 you can go to my future trading course
00:00:15.200 where i talk about those or to give you
00:00:16.720 a quick tl dr local is the most
00:00:18.880 localized trend global is the grand is
00:00:21.039 the father to that trend and legacy
00:00:22.800 would be the grandfather to the local
00:00:24.480 trend or the father to the global trend
00:00:26.320 so it's kind of like a trend
00:00:27.439 architecture trends within trends within
00:00:29.039 trends with that said we can start
00:00:31.359 marking out some trends here okay let's
00:00:34.079 first go and
00:00:36.559 take our replayer to allah and then
00:00:38.079 we're going to go and mark our trends so
00:00:39.360 we do have a range trend now range
00:00:41.360 trends aren't covered in the series
00:00:42.559 rather it's covered in butterfly effect
00:00:44.000 stuff so we do have a range trend here
00:00:46.160 where you have
00:00:47.280 accumulation to accumulation candle and
00:00:49.520 the reach point to this trend is going
00:00:51.760 to create a trend underneath it if we
00:00:53.760 were to never draw any trends past this
00:00:56.000 first trend we are simply stating that
00:00:58.000 this is your localized trend this is the
00:00:59.840 next one up on the chopping board this
00:01:02.399 is your local trend so what we're going
00:01:04.319 to do is we're actually going to create
00:01:05.280 some architecture we are going to mark
00:01:07.439 the reach point of the previous trend as
00:01:09.520 the base point to the new trend and we
00:01:11.600 are simply going to market to the next
00:01:13.200 accumulation candle once you've done
00:01:15.920 that you now have a new local trend this
00:01:18.320 is your local trend and the one above it
00:01:20.000 is the global trend and if you were to
00:01:21.439 add another one then you'd have one more
00:01:23.520 further definition of trends and you
00:01:25.200 could actually just keep going with
00:01:26.240 these they can actually they can never
00:01:27.920 end you could go and you could create
00:01:29.600 another one right here and then the base
00:01:31.520 point would be
00:01:32.799 this would be the reach point and that
00:01:34.000 would create another one right here
00:01:35.280 typically i like to keep this to three
00:01:38.000 trends as once you get beyond three
00:01:40.799 trends you're kind of just spinning your
00:01:42.000 wheels and you're not really getting any
00:01:43.840 extra valuable information but you could
00:01:45.439 literally have 10 or 15 trends that just
00:01:47.920 array from each other all the way down a
00:01:49.840 nice shortcut that i like to do is when
00:01:51.840 we don't have a clear trend connected i
00:01:54.000 like to go to the floating trend point
00:01:56.079 or sorry the floating accumulation
00:01:57.439 candle for the simple fact that this
00:01:59.119 would be the fifth or the sixth trend
00:02:00.799 down the line you would have this one
00:02:03.040 right here
00:02:04.640 let's mark this properly you'd have this
00:02:07.200 one right here which would float all the
00:02:09.038 way to there and then you could mark
00:02:10.560 another one you could adapt it in time
00:02:12.480 frame out to here and then that would
00:02:14.480 mark one like this well you can simply
00:02:16.560 shortcut all of that
00:02:18.000 extra unnecessary work and you can just
00:02:20.080 take this trend out and you can just
00:02:21.840 stick with three trends so whenever
00:02:24.720 you're thinking about trends and how
00:02:26.319 they react this is what happens a local
00:02:29.120 will break it will stop at the global a
00:02:30.959 global will break it will stop at the
00:02:32.879 legacy and then when a global gets hit
00:02:35.040 it usually has a pullback creates a new
00:02:36.959 local
00:02:38.319 when the global breaks it hits the
00:02:40.160 legacy pulls back and creates a new
00:02:42.879 local which you think would be global
00:02:44.480 but it's not because the legacy trend
00:02:46.080 would then be local to that moment so
00:02:47.760 it's always important to remember that
00:02:50.239 with this trend architecture
00:02:52.480 once you've hit these legacy moments and
00:02:54.720 once you've hit these legacy trends
00:02:56.560 you're setting yourself up for a
00:02:58.239 breakout so this is the way it would
00:02:59.920 work you have your trend here this would
00:03:01.920 break it would hit that trend it would
00:03:03.840 pull back and create this trend as the
00:03:06.959 next architecture like that or maybe
00:03:09.280 that's pretty aggressive
00:03:11.200 you would have this one here to
00:03:13.599 that point there like that creating your
00:03:15.280 next the local trend so essentially
00:03:16.879 all's you'd be doing is you'd be moving
00:03:19.920 base point to there
00:03:21.599 and you'd be moving this reach point to
00:03:24.640 there and you'd be creating a new trend
00:03:26.239 off the attack of that old trend which
00:03:28.000 would just further give you the next
00:03:29.840 piece of your trend work so a nice
00:03:32.799 strategy is when you've broken or
00:03:35.440 breaking when you've broken when you've
00:03:37.120 broken these trends
00:03:39.440 don't try to aim for a target that's too
00:03:41.760 much outside of what the trend will
00:03:44.080 allow because it's going to have a
00:03:45.440 pullback and it's going to allow you to
00:03:46.879 get back into trade now that's not to
00:03:48.720 say every single trade is going to go
00:03:50.799 like this comes up hits pulls back
00:03:53.680 sometimes what's going to happen is
00:03:54.959 you're just going to break over this and
00:03:56.319 go right over that too but if you were
00:03:58.159 to kind of take an average sampling size
00:04:00.319 of these you would notice that this is
00:04:01.920 going to be a very common occurrence
00:04:03.920 where you hit it and pull back and the
00:04:05.760 occurrence where you break right through
00:04:07.040 it is typically going to be on set by
00:04:08.799 something very different and is going to
00:04:10.720 be quite rare to be honest so the amount
00:04:12.560 of profits that you lose by not locking
00:04:14.400 up a trend to a trend
00:04:16.478 trade and just getting into the lower
00:04:18.238 price to reattack that trend is going to
00:04:20.000 be substantial so the best way you can
00:04:23.040 attack trends and take your trades when
00:04:25.280 a trend breaks as you
00:04:27.280 let it hit take your exits on your trend
00:04:30.080 let it pull back get back in where the
00:04:32.240 move is going to hold whatever hold
00:04:33.600 level is created and then allow that to
00:04:36.000 break the trend because once you've
00:04:37.280 tested this trend once then it can break
00:04:39.520 if you haven't tested it and it's kind
00:04:40.960 of just floated out to this moment like
00:04:42.560 this where it hasn't been tested in a
00:04:43.840 while you should probably take your exit
00:04:45.919 on that trend so whenever you're using
00:04:47.759 these trends and creating kind of this
00:04:49.199 trend architecture on the charts just be
00:04:51.040 aware of how many times they've been hit
00:04:52.880 if you're going and attacking it for the
00:04:54.240 first time it makes for a great
00:04:55.520 opportunity to either short or take
00:04:57.520 profits on a long and then you can get
00:04:59.759 back in it if the move holds and creates
00:05:01.680 maybe another ladder point or uses a
00:05:03.120 whole level it can go up it can attack
00:05:04.960 the trend you can take your profits and
00:05:06.720 hey maybe it starts laddering up like
00:05:08.400 this off of this trend and then you can
00:05:10.000 take that next trend trade as well and
00:05:12.000 you can go after this one and you could
00:05:13.680 do the same thing and get out of the
00:05:14.720 trade here and just kind of constantly
00:05:16.800 repeat that pattern so this is a great
00:05:19.039 strategy for trends as it gives you a
00:05:20.720 lot of safety and it guarantees profits
00:05:22.960 alright see on the next one

# Day Trade Strategy Series 8 Scalp Trades
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/nZM1j1ICXfo

00:00:00.240 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.159 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.840 the markets and in this video we're
00:00:05.359 going to be talking about scalp trades
00:00:06.560 how to get in them and when to get in
00:00:07.919 them every single trade you will ever
00:00:10.000 take in your life no matter what the
00:00:11.679 time frame whether it's a swing trade
00:00:12.960 over an hour or four hours or however
00:00:15.280 you define a swing trade a position
00:00:16.960 trade that lasts for weeks an investment
00:00:18.960 that lasts for years
00:00:20.560 everything starts and before any of
00:00:22.080 those things can happen everything
00:00:23.519 starts as a scalp so this is a key piece
00:00:26.320 of information to keep in your mind and
00:00:27.680 something to realize from the very early
00:00:29.840 stages of trading every single trade
00:00:31.840 starts as a scalp a scalp can then
00:00:34.239 mature into a swing trade a swing trade
00:00:36.239 can then mature into a position trade or
00:00:38.320 an investment so it's very important to
00:00:40.480 realize that if we master scalps we can
00:00:43.280 then create a criteria going forward
00:00:44.879 that can redefine scalps into swings now
00:00:47.360 a quick
00:00:48.640 i guess you want to call this a rule or
00:00:50.079 a quick example is that only one in
00:00:53.840 about 10 trades that our scalps can
00:00:55.920 actually turn into swings it's not like
00:00:57.280 you can just sit there and be a swing
00:00:58.559 trader and say hey every trade i'm in
00:01:00.559 has the potential to be a swing trade
00:01:02.559 while this is true it's highly
00:01:03.840 inaccurate and not very efficient it's
00:01:05.920 actually only about 1 in 10 trades that
00:01:07.760 are scalp trades that meet a criteria
00:01:09.680 that could phase them into being a swing
00:01:11.520 trade and then the same thing fourth and
00:01:13.200 if only one in ten swing trades can be a
00:01:15.119 position trade
00:01:16.320 well then you're at like one in a
00:01:17.680 hundred trades is actually a position
00:01:19.119 trade and out of the sample size of a
00:01:21.040 hundred trades that sounds about right
00:01:23.680 out of every hundred trades i take maybe
00:01:25.600 one of them has a criteria to enter into
00:01:27.439 a position status where it's just you
00:01:29.360 hold it long-term and it just keeps
00:01:31.360 growing wouldn't that be great isn't
00:01:32.960 that the dream of every single trader
00:01:34.799 and investor just kind of buy something
00:01:36.880 and hold it and make money while you sit
00:01:39.119 on a beach because everything is a
00:01:40.320 perfect position trade and everything
00:01:41.680 just makes money no matter what you do
00:01:42.960 you just walk away and the world is
00:01:44.799 beautiful because all your things
00:01:46.079 they're all position trades and they all
00:01:47.360 just make money forever on end and being
00:01:49.840 an investor actually
00:01:51.759 it would even be further just put money
00:01:53.759 in things and just let them grow well
00:01:55.280 you just sip coconuts on the beach sip
00:01:57.280 coconut water or pina coladas or
00:01:59.520 whatever so this is kind of the the
00:02:01.200 mindset
00:02:02.640 that you have to start thinking about
00:02:04.240 because in the perfect world everything
00:02:06.000 would be a position or an investment
00:02:07.439 because we wouldn't have to do anything
00:02:08.479 and although the money would just grow
00:02:09.598 out of the ground like magic
00:02:11.520 but to get there you have about a
00:02:13.599 hundred scalps that happen first per
00:02:16.000 swing or sorry per position trade and
00:02:17.840 then 10 for the swing trades so with
00:02:20.640 that said we have to master scallop
00:02:23.120 trading first this is ground zero for
00:02:25.280 day traders now the way we master scalp
00:02:28.080 trading is by doing all the things we
00:02:29.680 talked about before and kind of creating
00:02:31.840 these overlying criterias ladder points
00:02:34.239 and hole levels and trends and all these
00:02:35.599 different things that we could be using
00:02:37.920 and we start working down in time frames
00:02:39.519 to make sense out of things so this is a
00:02:40.959 very logical thought out process we
00:02:42.959 don't overthink it by going into the the
00:02:45.360 greediest time frames and saying or
00:02:47.599 sorry the greatest time frames and
00:02:48.800 saying hey there's a level way up here
00:02:50.319 let's just wait for that
00:02:51.920 if you were to just constantly wait for
00:02:53.280 levels say you only take one trade a day
00:02:56.800 and if only one out of 100 trades could
00:02:59.200 be a position trade then maybe once a
00:03:01.599 year you might be able to get into a
00:03:03.040 good position trade that might last two
00:03:04.560 weeks or longer and this might not even
00:03:06.159 be a trade that goes in your direction
00:03:07.680 you might exit it so mastering scalp
00:03:10.000 trading and getting into trades
00:03:11.599 frequently and having these large sample
00:03:13.599 size really is beneficial for any trader
00:03:16.480 having that raw volume so whenever we
00:03:18.959 look at scalp trades we just start
00:03:20.239 defining criteria of hey let's look at
00:03:22.560 ranges well i'm going to do that real
00:03:24.319 quick on this video right now we're just
00:03:25.840 going to kind of look at um the entirety
00:03:28.000 of this chart and just kind of pick a
00:03:29.519 few spots that might look like good
00:03:30.720 swing trades we're gonna refresh our
00:03:32.239 page get it nice and snappy we always
00:03:34.080 want trading view to be uh quick and
00:03:35.840 quick and responsive so we always
00:03:37.440 refresh it pretty often
00:03:39.360 first off this is way too long waiting
00:03:40.959 up here i've got a trend here that looks
00:03:42.640 good i've got a level down here the the
00:03:44.720 raw truth is that i would have been in
00:03:46.159 down here uh the 15 minute level that we
00:03:48.080 dictated from the past it looks like it
00:03:49.760 got hit maybe it didn't i'm not quite
00:03:51.440 sure here
00:03:52.400 it never got hit move on let's move
00:03:54.480 forward in this chart where could we
00:03:56.159 enter this trade next so let's just say
00:03:58.239 that we want to develop some kind of
00:04:00.080 criteria so we've got a trend here we
00:04:02.159 can develop which is this five minute
00:04:04.080 bottom right here to this right here
00:04:05.760 great we've got a nice little trend that
00:04:07.519 we can work with so where can we take a
00:04:09.439 trade off of that let's just start
00:04:10.959 designing some spots that we can take a
00:04:12.560 trade well if that 15 minute didn't get
00:04:14.560 hit and this five minute did get hit i
00:04:16.560 think it's safe to say that you could go
00:04:18.079 after this five minute level which is
00:04:19.358 what it's trying to do right now
00:04:21.600 well it's a little too late to go after
00:04:23.040 that five minute level so let's keep
00:04:24.320 working with this chart and keep moving
00:04:25.919 down you've got a backside hold level
00:04:27.680 here that could ladder the move so that
00:04:29.520 could be one potential spot let's take
00:04:31.199 this off the chart to clean it up a bit
00:04:33.280 you have got a hold level that's being
00:04:35.440 developed right here so if this breaks
00:04:37.040 over top of this and creates it as a
00:04:38.320 whole level it would be another great
00:04:39.680 spot a little more advanced than what
00:04:41.120 we're doing today but that's okay you've
00:04:43.120 got another five minute rate here but
00:04:45.600 maybe we can find a better spot maybe
00:04:47.360 there's something if we keep
00:04:48.320 investigating in this chart there's like
00:04:49.680 kind of a better spot so we've got a
00:04:51.040 three minute level here aha you see
00:04:52.960 deeper in the five minute time frame we
00:04:54.400 found a three-minute level and that's
00:04:55.520 perfect this one's already hit so that's
00:04:56.880 no good
00:04:57.840 let's move forward we know that the
00:04:59.040 three-minute level is the one that's
00:05:00.080 going to be used now darn this
00:05:01.759 three-minute level got hit too so i
00:05:03.520 think it's safe to say we could go after
00:05:05.440 this because you know what those three
00:05:06.560 minute levels hit what about a one
00:05:08.080 minute do we have anything even crazier
00:05:10.000 than that yeah we could get a little
00:05:11.520 greedier in this trade
00:05:13.600 and we could actually say one of two
00:05:15.120 spots we could either go after this here
00:05:17.520 i don't like going up to this one minute
00:05:19.280 level because three minute levels
00:05:20.560 already hit so if we wanted to do that
00:05:22.880 we'd be essentially saying let's go
00:05:24.320 after the latter point so we could
00:05:25.919 either choose between this one minute
00:05:27.280 level or this not as a whole level but
00:05:29.120 as a ladder point to the trade so then
00:05:31.600 you'd be saying hey this could latter
00:05:33.440 this 15 minute part of the trade so then
00:05:35.520 you would just assess this based on risk
00:05:37.120 if you are like 100x trader and you have
00:05:39.440 to take these extreme spots with no risk
00:05:42.000 well i think going a little lower here
00:05:43.600 in the trade would make more sense you
00:05:45.440 might miss the trade but when you're
00:05:46.800 doing like big 100x trading or to 50x or
00:05:49.280 125x or 75 whatever your derivatives or
00:05:52.400 futures
00:05:53.440 market is for you
00:05:54.960 then i think you're always going to take
00:05:56.000 the greedier spot if you're using spot
00:05:58.479 or small margin i think you can get away
00:06:00.240 with taking this higher up spot and
00:06:01.919 allowing it to have kind of a backup
00:06:03.600 level and if it breaks below this backup
00:06:06.080 level you can say well i'm either going
00:06:07.919 to see if it holds trend or i'm just
00:06:09.199 going to get out because i believe that
00:06:10.560 this trend is failing i would probably
00:06:12.479 just get out if we don't hold this level
00:06:14.800 because i don't like how we laddered off
00:06:17.360 this hourly rate here so i'm saying that
00:06:20.479 hey we hit this inverse level um i don't
00:06:23.280 think it's very smart to be buying trend
00:06:24.880 it looks like we might just be breaking
00:06:26.080 down so i kind of just have two levels
00:06:27.759 that i set out as my parameters and this
00:06:30.160 allows me to create a scalp trade by
00:06:33.120 defining these parameters
00:06:35.280 now because this is at the bottom of the
00:06:39.120 move it can then turn into a swing trade
00:06:40.880 which we're going to talk about in the
00:06:42.400 next video we're going to talk about how
00:06:44.080 we can turn this from a scalp trade into
00:06:47.199 a swing trade and then just keep that in
00:06:48.800 mind because the same thing is going to
00:06:50.319 be true for swing trades every time you
00:06:52.800 get into a swing trade it's maybe one in
00:06:54.560 every 10 swing trades that can actually
00:06:56.080 turn into a position trade so even just
00:06:58.319 talking about this out loud and kind of
00:07:00.720 just creating
00:07:02.400 this defining criteria of hey what does
00:07:05.199 it actually mean to make a scalp trade
00:07:06.720 and how many times you have to get into
00:07:08.479 scalp trades
00:07:09.680 turn it into a swing trade just by
00:07:11.280 defining this criteria we are taking a
00:07:13.520 very smart concept and and applying some
00:07:16.160 knowledge to it to say
00:07:19.120 we don't always have the opportunity to
00:07:20.639 get into swing trades so don't enter
00:07:22.560 every single trade with the idea of
00:07:24.400 let's see where this thing can go the
00:07:26.479 only time we can just say that and be
00:07:28.400 like oh let's see where this thing can
00:07:29.680 go is when it's actually meeting that
00:07:31.599 criteria and that candidation for
00:07:34.400 turning into a swing trade you couldn't
00:07:36.319 turn a trade in the middle of a range
00:07:38.400 into a swing trade if you were taking a
00:07:40.319 trade up here this might not make sense
00:07:42.240 as a swing trade it's got too much up
00:07:43.840 and down it could do so a common
00:07:45.759 occurrence is you have a level like this
00:07:48.240 right
00:07:49.520 and you enter you you've broken above
00:07:51.599 price and you enter
00:07:53.440 long back right here when it comes back
00:07:55.360 and touches it and then it moves up and
00:07:57.440 it hits this level right here at this
00:08:00.160 point you have to leave the trade as
00:08:01.840 it's just a scalp trade you can't just
00:08:03.360 kind of
00:08:04.319 be in this thing on the right side of
00:08:05.759 things and see where it goes because if
00:08:07.759 that level's holding it down
00:08:09.520 you could come all the way down here and
00:08:11.520 then you could move up and you might
00:08:13.039 exit your trade and how often does that
00:08:14.960 happen to people when they're in a trade
00:08:17.199 they're trying to long something or
00:08:18.479 they're trying to short something
00:08:19.520 they're in a trade it goes in their
00:08:21.120 direction a little bit then it goes
00:08:22.879 against them only to go back in their
00:08:24.720 direction and it's like oh well i was
00:08:26.479 right but i had to leave the trade and i
00:08:27.840 lost money so that's kind of like a very
00:08:30.080 common thing and the realization that
00:08:32.479 there's only so many trades that can
00:08:34.559 turn into swing trades or so many times
00:08:37.200 that you should be in scalp trades
00:08:39.279 this clears that up instantly for people
00:08:41.519 and allows them to see forward in any
00:08:43.519 charts and trade so let's go check our
00:08:44.959 swing trade and see how things are going
00:08:46.720 here our swing trade yeah right see i
00:08:48.240 tried to trick you guys there it's a
00:08:49.360 scalp trade it can't be a swing trade
00:08:50.720 yet
00:08:52.320 so we've defined our level it hit it to
00:08:54.240 perfection and now it's moving up giving
00:08:56.399 us kind of perfect safety in this trade
00:08:58.560 so we probably caught this thing pretty
00:09:00.240 close because we simply used the correct
00:09:02.240 level in the moment
00:09:04.240 price on this was four seven eight
00:09:06.240 ninety fifty seven four seven eight
00:09:08.399 ninety ninety nine so we were within a
00:09:10.240 dollar of this trade which is pretty
00:09:12.640 incredible accuracy if you ask me so
00:09:15.040 that's the perfect way to
00:09:17.360 look at a trade and the perfect kind of
00:09:19.600 opening mindset to re-scoping and
00:09:22.480 rescaling the way in which you should
00:09:24.240 look at your trades
00:09:25.839 remember
00:09:27.040 scalp first master them swings can't
00:09:29.680 exist without scalps and positions can't
00:09:31.360 exist without swings therefore nothing
00:09:33.040 can exist without a scalp
00:09:35.040 in the next video

00:00:00.160 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:01.839 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.520 the markets in this video we're going to
00:00:05.040 be talking about swing trades
00:00:07.200 okay now we're on to swing trades so i
00:00:09.760 think it's very clear at this point that
00:00:11.679 everything starts as a scalp trade you
00:00:14.160 cannot have anything past scalp trades
00:00:16.320 until you master the scalp trade now i
00:00:19.439 don't like to say it's kind of common
00:00:20.800 sense because that's not an accurate
00:00:22.000 depiction here it's what i call total
00:00:24.480 sense it's common sense once you know it
00:00:26.720 but that's not so common because unless
00:00:28.400 you're told that it kind of is something
00:00:29.920 that you wouldn't really ever think
00:00:30.880 about therefore i like the term it's
00:00:32.880 total sense it makes total sense it's
00:00:34.640 common sense once you know it so this
00:00:36.640 makes total sense as to why we can never
00:00:38.879 enter a trade right off the bat as a
00:00:41.040 swing trade so if you ever meet someone
00:00:42.719 that says i'm just a swing trader
00:00:45.440 i think they're missing a piece if you
00:00:46.800 ever meet somebody who's saying i'm an
00:00:48.480 investor well now we're swinging with a
00:00:50.399 baseball bat and a blindfold on so i
00:00:52.320 think you get the picture when you're
00:00:53.600 day trading or trader any type of
00:00:55.199 investor anybody who has any type of
00:00:56.719 stake in these markets of any type even
00:00:58.719 if it's just as an investor
00:01:00.559 if you were to master how to scalp trade
00:01:02.719 first it would open the doors to say hey
00:01:06.080 this is a great scalp trade and it's
00:01:07.680 starting to meet the criteria of what
00:01:09.200 could turn into a swing trade and then
00:01:10.960 one in every 10 swing trades it would
00:01:12.560 fall under that same umbrella where you
00:01:13.920 could say hey this swing trade is going
00:01:15.520 great it's ticking all the boxes i can
00:01:17.280 leave this thing to continue to go now
00:01:19.439 we're watching a scalp trade that we
00:01:20.720 defined earlier and with the same
00:01:22.880 understanding that hey not everything is
00:01:25.360 going to turn into a swing trade if you
00:01:26.880 were to leave this trade you would
00:01:28.720 probably lose money
00:01:30.560 a lot of the time by just saying let's
00:01:32.240 see where it goes and then you get
00:01:33.520 people who have perfect entries on
00:01:35.520 trades they never have a criteria to say
00:01:39.119 well you know what could actually turn
00:01:40.880 this into a swing trade and they kind of
00:01:43.360 just constantly lose money so i'm going
00:01:45.119 to talk about some of the criteria that
00:01:46.399 you can look for
00:01:47.759 going forward in trade to say hey this
00:01:50.479 is a scalp trade we're in already what
00:01:52.479 could turn this into a swing trade so
00:01:54.240 the first thing i would do here is i
00:01:55.920 would say okay we got the perfect entry
00:01:57.840 on a trade now we need to have some kind
00:01:59.439 of heads-up thinking to say what would
00:02:01.360 this need to do in order to break this
00:02:03.600 move up and keep moving up and not just
00:02:05.600 be a scalp trade that we have to exit
00:02:07.600 well if you hard close under this i
00:02:09.360 think it's pretty obvious that you're
00:02:10.878 going to be dumping this move so you've
00:02:12.319 got about 30 seconds left in this trade
00:02:14.480 before you're going to start moving down
00:02:16.239 now you've got a few things going on
00:02:17.520 here technically you're laddering right
00:02:19.200 now so you're holding the move you had
00:02:21.280 this point which created the whole level
00:02:22.800 here which gave you your whole level
00:02:24.160 here which is what you hit and you're
00:02:25.840 laddering to here so you've kind of got
00:02:27.680 this architecture in the moment building
00:02:29.280 hold uh ladder point ladder point ladder
00:02:31.599 point created off of hold ladder here
00:02:33.599 ladder there so you're kind of actually
00:02:35.280 laddering in the move now so you want to
00:02:37.040 create a hold level that you can break
00:02:38.879 over
00:02:39.680 and something that you don't hard close
00:02:41.280 underneath so if this candle closed a
00:02:43.040 little bit lower uh well i think it
00:02:44.879 would be safe to say that this thing was
00:02:46.480 moving down and it's going to fail its
00:02:47.760 move however right now it's trying to
00:02:49.760 hold its move to turn into a swing trade
00:02:51.840 and be out of this criteria of a scalp
00:02:54.239 trade by leaving this trend so if we can
00:02:56.800 continue to ladder here and maybe this
00:02:59.040 can turn into a hold level well we can
00:03:00.879 now start to develop criteria that will
00:03:03.440 allow us to be in this trade so we
00:03:04.800 really have to get up and over this
00:03:06.400 thing
00:03:07.680 and create some accumulation over top of
00:03:09.440 this so it can kind of be a shield in
00:03:11.200 the future if you want to think of it
00:03:12.400 that way if we have a whole level that's
00:03:13.840 holding us there it can be something
00:03:15.519 that protects our trade so you can see
00:03:17.599 it's not actually happening so you've
00:03:19.280 got to kind of exit your trade here and
00:03:20.879 just say like okay well it didn't work
00:03:22.959 out onto the next trade and you're not
00:03:24.959 really going to have a lot of
00:03:26.400 opportunities to create these things so
00:03:28.480 you could wait till the end of the one
00:03:29.760 minute here
00:03:31.360 if you're a futures trader you'd be out
00:03:32.799 of this now if you're a margin or spot
00:03:34.640 you could be in this trade still and say
00:03:36.239 well you know we're still laddering off
00:03:38.000 this so you know technically we've hit
00:03:40.080 this whole level now and what's the
00:03:41.920 criteria going forward you have to
00:03:43.360 develop a whole level here while still
00:03:45.360 holding this ladder point so now you've
00:03:46.879 developed your new criteria to see if
00:03:48.480 the scalp can continue to be a scalp and
00:03:50.959 sometimes you're just going to get an
00:03:52.080 opportunity where it moves up a little
00:03:53.680 bit like this and you have to get out of
00:03:55.040 the trade because it keeps holding it
00:03:56.239 and a scalp
00:03:58.239 is left as a scalp you make a little bit
00:04:00.480 of money on it and you're on to the next
00:04:02.400 one if it's not working out you just
00:04:03.920 move on to the next one right now we've
00:04:05.760 hit kind of our one of our last ladder
00:04:07.760 points in the move
00:04:09.120 we've now hit this hold level we can
00:04:11.120 create this as a hold and that's it so
00:04:13.519 now you've got your criteria right there
00:04:15.519 but again i don't really think this is
00:04:17.358 moving up i think it's more of kind of
00:04:19.040 collapsing down and and falling over if
00:04:21.199 you're asking me my opinion in the
00:04:22.479 moment
00:04:23.520 this doesn't really look like it's going
00:04:24.720 to hold its move rather maybe it's going
00:04:26.320 to go to a lower part of the move
00:04:28.479 unless this holds its move and develops
00:04:29.919 this as a whole level you can't turn
00:04:31.520 this into a swing trade and then you're
00:04:32.720 going to move up in time frames and say
00:04:34.080 that same thing now if this stabilizes
00:04:36.479 for long enough maybe you have a three
00:04:38.160 minute hole level that develops here in
00:04:39.759 about four seconds you're going gonna
00:04:41.040 have something that's starting to
00:04:42.320 develop so on a higher time frame you
00:04:44.400 may be able to create your next three
00:04:46.240 minute hold level and if you remember
00:04:48.960 this had created a trail of different
00:04:51.120 trades on the three-minute hold levels
00:04:52.800 from all the way back here right if you
00:04:54.720 go back into this trade you can see you
00:04:56.560 have a three minute hold level right
00:04:58.000 here that created the next whole level
00:04:59.840 in the move which is right here they
00:05:01.199 created the next hole level in the move
00:05:02.800 which is right here which is now
00:05:04.080 creating the next whole level in the
00:05:05.600 move so if in the next three minutes you
00:05:07.600 close above this then you'd start
00:05:09.199 building more and more criteria that
00:05:11.120 could support this move up but it's
00:05:13.360 always our job as day traders when we
00:05:15.280 get into these positions as scalp trades
00:05:18.160 before we decide if they're going to
00:05:19.600 turn into anything else where we're
00:05:20.880 going to hold this or whether we're
00:05:22.160 going to take quick profits and be in it
00:05:24.800 sometimes we're on a trade for 30
00:05:26.080 seconds because that's all the profit
00:05:27.360 dictates and we want to protect our
00:05:28.720 accounts sometimes we're in trades for
00:05:30.639 longer periods of time but we always
00:05:32.560 have to work forward in this criteria
00:05:34.639 and say hey what time is it right now 3
00:05:36.560 45 uh oh i think we just developed a 15
00:05:39.280 minute level
00:05:40.400 so
00:05:41.120 if we were in this scalp trade and over
00:05:43.759 the next 15 minutes we start to
00:05:45.039 stabilize and move above this level well
00:05:46.720 that would be a great indication that
00:05:48.960 you've developed a higher time frame
00:05:51.199 level to hold up the move so that when
00:05:53.600 you go over this right you come here you
00:05:56.160 go over top of this level it's the
00:05:57.759 perfect move to support you in the
00:05:59.520 future because if it loses this on this
00:06:01.759 side and goes down well you can still
00:06:03.440 get out in profits from these positions
00:06:04.880 down here right and if it
00:06:07.600 on the alternative hits this and moves
00:06:09.440 up well now you've got the candidation
00:06:11.120 for a swing trade you've started to
00:06:13.120 develop larger levels and then you can
00:06:14.800 just keep going up
00:06:16.319 now you can go to the hourly and say
00:06:18.080 whoa look at this we could actually
00:06:19.840 create an hourly hold level if we just
00:06:21.199 get over top of this so let's delete all
00:06:22.800 this other stuff see where that hourly
00:06:24.479 level is because this will be a big mark
00:06:26.800 going forward in the future
00:06:28.639 or if you hold around this price for the
00:06:30.880 next i don't know 15 minutes and create
00:06:33.280 a new hourly candle then maybe this
00:06:35.280 would be the whole level that could hold
00:06:36.720 you up so this is the type of analysis
00:06:39.199 that you have to do when you are looking
00:06:41.520 at hey i'm in a scalp trade can this
00:06:43.360 turn into a swing trade does it have the
00:06:45.199 supporting criteria and the strong
00:06:47.120 levels the three minute can we can we
00:06:49.039 take that three minute
00:06:50.639 and can it hold this price and is it
00:06:52.000 going to be a five minute tune what
00:06:53.280 about that 15 minute candle is it 3 15
00:06:55.360 in the afternoon right now and it's
00:06:56.400 going to take 45 minutes for an hourly
00:06:58.000 candle to create or is it 355 and in
00:07:00.800 five minutes if we kind of hold this
00:07:02.639 price hey we've got an hourly hold level
00:07:04.639 there and it we just need to like move
00:07:06.720 20 or 30 to get above it man we're in
00:07:09.120 the clear this is looking more and more
00:07:10.960 and more like instead of being a scalp
00:07:12.560 trade i should stay in this longer and
00:07:14.400 turn it into a swing trade so this is
00:07:16.160 kind of the criteria that you're looking
00:07:17.520 at creating these trades and if you go
00:07:19.599 back and look at the hourly um yeah
00:07:22.479 we've got 12 minutes to
00:07:24.800 hold this point so that we can create a
00:07:26.880 whole level here or 12 minutes to simply
00:07:29.120 get over top of this one and if we get
00:07:30.639 over top of this one guess what you're
00:07:32.880 going to be in pretty good shape to be
00:07:34.639 in a swing trade
00:07:36.319 see you on the next video which is all
00:07:37.840 about position trading

00:00:00.399 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.399 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:04.160 the markets in this video we're going to
00:00:05.440 be talking about position trades okay
00:00:08.000 let's talk about position trades this is
00:00:10.800 the ultimate goal of every single trader
00:00:12.880 just be in position trades where the
00:00:14.799 money is just printing
00:00:16.800 from wherever you are in the world it's
00:00:18.320 just a money tree that grows out of the
00:00:19.760 ground just constantly printing money
00:00:21.520 all day long like this is as clear as
00:00:23.920 day the number one solution for any day
00:00:26.480 trader just set it and forget it the
00:00:27.920 slap chop of trades this is not
00:00:30.080 realistic to just try to get into trades
00:00:31.679 and hold them long term so you know
00:00:33.440 we're going back to the saying that we
00:00:34.640 talked about the last video people who
00:00:36.320 say oh i'm a position trader or i'm an
00:00:38.000 investor
00:00:38.960 you're a blindfolded baseball player
00:00:40.800 that's the way i like to look at it
00:00:42.719 you're just swinging a bat in the dark
00:00:44.640 and it's okay to say that
00:00:46.719 yeah i like to sit in trades long term
00:00:48.879 and uh this is a fine dictation to make
00:00:50.800 and it's fine to say like oh i prefer
00:00:52.559 that but the realism is is that you have
00:00:55.039 to look at these trades as look at how
00:00:57.280 hard it is to turn a scalp trade into a
00:00:59.520 swing trade and now the same theorem and
00:01:02.480 concept moves forward because only so
00:01:04.159 many scalp trades can turn into position
00:01:06.320 trades
00:01:07.520 perfect idea would be this right here
00:01:09.680 where you have this 15 minute level it
00:01:11.760 is already a swing trade you have
00:01:13.760 already entered this 15-minute level
00:01:15.759 from the past back here you have already
00:01:17.600 held this 15-minute level and if you are
00:01:19.759 still in this trade guess what you're
00:01:20.960 technically in a swing trade because
00:01:22.479 it's outside the criteria of a scalp
00:01:23.920 trade but now that you're in a swing
00:01:25.520 trade how do you define the criteria so
00:01:27.439 we can get rid of this how do you define
00:01:29.040 the criteria of what should turn this
00:01:31.040 into a position trade where can you just
00:01:33.680 sit here and say well i'm just going to
00:01:34.960 let it go overnight or or you know some
00:01:36.720 of these other
00:01:37.840 time frames that you'd want to allude to
00:01:39.600 well the first thing you would do is
00:01:40.799 you'd have trends you'd have your larger
00:01:42.320 time frame trend so in this case we have
00:01:43.840 a 15 to a 15 minute trend as always we
00:01:46.000 start highest time frame down we know it
00:01:47.680 can't possibly be the four hour because
00:01:49.119 there's just not some simply not enough
00:01:50.479 time in this trade so let's start by
00:01:52.479 defining trends let's assume that we're
00:01:54.960 in this trade from
00:01:57.119 like i had mentioned before from earlier
00:01:59.360 in the day right you hit that 15 minute
00:02:01.200 level and you got the perfect trading
00:02:02.320 and just sitting in this thing so you've
00:02:03.759 got your first trend here which is
00:02:05.040 distribution to distribution on the one
00:02:06.719 hour charts which is all that you have
00:02:08.800 you move forward in the trade and this
00:02:10.080 becomes your actual trend well the
00:02:11.840 problem is is that you've actually
00:02:12.959 broken this trend on the higher time
00:02:14.640 frame so you actually have to use the 15
00:02:16.640 minute trend so when you have a higher
00:02:18.959 time frame trend like this and you've
00:02:20.560 broken both sides of it and you haven't
00:02:22.239 started to move up on the higher time
00:02:23.520 frames yet you can just go and take the
00:02:25.440 highest time frame available which in
00:02:27.280 this case it makes total sense because
00:02:29.520 you don't have that many candles to be
00:02:31.840 creating one hour trends even 15 is a
00:02:33.840 little
00:02:34.800 you know obnoxious to be honest with you
00:02:36.720 it's a little obnoxious at this point
00:02:38.160 you would almost want to be using this
00:02:40.000 trend right here like five minutes to
00:02:41.840 five minutes and saying oh my god we're
00:02:43.360 actually breaking the trend because this
00:02:44.640 is the trend that was first developed
00:02:46.160 and then it would be like this so
00:02:47.680 actually your first trend that was
00:02:48.720 developed would have been this and these
00:02:50.160 had helped that trend back from the past
00:02:52.720 at that point you could say this is my
00:02:54.560 absolute emergency exit on my swing
00:02:56.720 trade because i don't trust it to go any
00:02:58.400 further down and you could see if it
00:03:00.239 follows this trend moving up and this
00:03:02.480 would be like having two different
00:03:03.680 trends as you're in a swing trade one to
00:03:05.360 say hey i want to take profits if we
00:03:07.440 break this higher trend so i'm going to
00:03:08.800 make this one a dotted line and you can
00:03:10.319 say i'm just going to be in this until
00:03:11.760 trend breaks and i'm going to just lock
00:03:13.120 up my profits of course if you were
00:03:15.280 defining that as hey
00:03:18.400 cotton what about the profits missed up
00:03:20.000 top well you had your level here which
00:03:21.680 was hit to perfection and that was an
00:03:23.280 hourly level so if you were really
00:03:24.959 concerned about taking profits this
00:03:26.480 wouldn't be a position trade this would
00:03:28.959 just be a swing trade and you would have
00:03:30.239 no candidation to say well i wanted to
00:03:33.040 see this thing go into a position trade
00:03:35.360 you would have taken your active profits
00:03:37.120 at the the cap that it for you this is a
00:03:39.519 swing trade so so that's out the window
00:03:41.599 you can't sit there and say well yeah
00:03:43.280 but you left profits on the table okay
00:03:44.879 then accept the fact that you're on a
00:03:45.920 swing trade if you want to turn this
00:03:47.040 into a position trade this is the kind
00:03:49.040 of criteria you have to use you have to
00:03:50.720 develop trends and one would be
00:03:52.720 your first trend here would be it would
00:03:54.560 represent something like this
00:03:56.959 take
00:03:58.840 profits we'll call it take some type of
00:04:01.120 profits take some profits
00:04:03.120 not the the perfect trade because we
00:04:04.640 could have got out on the hourly
00:04:07.439 we're going to go on the top
00:04:09.120 and we're going to go to the center of
00:04:10.879 this thing let's go to the right side
00:04:13.120 right side left i guess it just it's all
00:04:14.879 the same there this is your take some
00:04:16.720 profits and let's change the text color
00:04:19.040 to something that's a little bit more
00:04:20.639 readable hubble blue or what about just
00:04:22.479 white take some profits there we go take
00:04:24.800 some profits trade so this would be the
00:04:26.800 first dictation if you wanted to just
00:04:28.080 take some profits that's not legible
00:04:29.759 either but i think we can move on from
00:04:31.120 the uh the color of the text here this
00:04:33.040 would be just hey i want to lock up
00:04:35.199 profits because my swing trade is
00:04:36.880 failing if you don't care about locking
00:04:38.880 up your profits you can take this away
00:04:40.800 and you can use your active trend which
00:04:42.880 is still going to be above where your
00:04:44.479 original buy spot was anyways so if you
00:04:47.280 mark
00:04:48.160 this like that you can you can take
00:04:50.240 profits if this starts to hard close
00:04:51.919 this trend before it breaks your level
00:04:54.000 and you've gotten into a trade where
00:04:55.440 you're saying yeah i'm okay risking
00:04:58.160 profits that i have in this trade
00:04:59.919 because again if you were just swing
00:05:01.280 trading you would have taken your
00:05:02.639 profits from
00:05:04.560 here to here and you have two percent
00:05:05.919 and if you're like me and you trade a
00:05:07.039 hundred x at twenty five hundred dollars
00:05:08.560 that would have been equal to five
00:05:09.600 thousand dollars so you would have made
00:05:10.720 your five grand on that trade and that's
00:05:12.800 it
00:05:13.759 alternatively you have this trend here
00:05:16.479 which is the 15 minute trend which is
00:05:18.080 going to be this guy to this guy
00:05:20.080 probably going to have around 80 or so
00:05:22.160 profits here
00:05:24.400 yeah you're around 80 profits
00:05:26.639 um if you measure from the bottom
00:05:27.919 property you're at exactly 80 profits
00:05:30.080 right there so if it breaks your trend
00:05:31.600 you're taking 80 you're taking a
00:05:32.960 fraction of what you would have if you
00:05:34.400 weren't saying this is a swing trade so
00:05:36.400 on the one side of it if you're in a
00:05:38.000 swing trade you take your profits at
00:05:39.520 target if you're trying to turn it into
00:05:40.800 a position trade you have two different
00:05:42.800 types of triggers in the trade one that
00:05:44.880 grants you some profits because you
00:05:46.320 still want to have kind of like a hybrid
00:05:47.759 system where you're not always taking
00:05:49.759 position
00:05:51.840 but you do like to expose yourself to
00:05:53.520 them so it's like a hybrid system where
00:05:54.639 you take some profits or where you only
00:05:56.800 ever want to enter position trades and
00:05:58.400 you're just literally a position trader
00:06:00.160 at least this allows you to understand
00:06:02.240 that you're going to do this 100 times
00:06:04.240 you're going to take 100 trades and one
00:06:05.840 in those hundred are actually going to
00:06:07.680 go and because remember a hundred scalps
00:06:09.759 is gonna be one position trade
00:06:12.080 and this is gonna happen a hundred times
00:06:13.600 or you take a trade and then you know in
00:06:15.680 one of these times it's gonna hold this
00:06:17.520 and you're gonna move up and you're
00:06:18.639 gonna actually turn this into a position
00:06:19.919 trade with larger profits so when you
00:06:21.520 start working with the numbers and you
00:06:23.039 start saying hey like
00:06:25.280 yeah only one in 100 trades is actually
00:06:26.880 going in my favor it very quickly puts
00:06:28.800 into perspective how you should be
00:06:30.240 looking at targets what the realization
00:06:32.319 of how many how much profits you can
00:06:33.520 make as a scalp trader i'm not saying
00:06:34.639 scalp trading is the ultimate form but i
00:06:36.560 think the ultimate form would be taking
00:06:38.639 a lot of scalp trades when you're at the
00:06:40.960 bottoms and tops of ranges start
00:06:43.199 thinking about what parts of those scalp
00:06:44.720 trades can turn into swing trades take
00:06:46.400 those swing trades and once you have a
00:06:48.639 bunch of scalps with swings attached
00:06:51.520 that are constantly laddering a move
00:06:53.039 then you can start to think about okay
00:06:55.039 now maybe it's time to turn that into a
00:06:57.199 position trade and what i mean by that
00:06:59.039 is you scalp this you take that long you
00:07:01.599 take this long you take this long you
00:07:03.919 take just a bunch of these little tiny
00:07:05.360 trades that have all these profits in
00:07:06.960 them to make a really great income and
00:07:09.440 you take one swing trade and you take
00:07:11.440 your profits right you take your profits
00:07:12.960 pretty uh pretty ideal scenario so far
00:07:14.960 you've taken a bunch of swing trade a
00:07:16.400 bunch of sculptures you've taken one
00:07:18.080 swing trade
00:07:19.280 you've made a bunch of profits and then
00:07:20.880 you just allow this to constantly sit
00:07:23.599 and ladder this move maybe it goes down
00:07:25.360 here you haven't taken another trade yet
00:07:26.960 it does this it ladders there breaks up
00:07:29.280 to here comes back down again ladders
00:07:31.280 off of here this holds and it's kind of
00:07:33.520 gone through the scenario where
00:07:35.360 yeah okay one swing trade has happened a
00:07:37.440 short swing trade has happened too a
00:07:39.039 third swing trade has happened three a
00:07:40.960 fourth swing trade has happened four now
00:07:42.800 maybe this fifth one is actually
00:07:44.400 breaking this trend and then you take
00:07:46.319 that as a swing trade and it goes up
00:07:47.759 here a fifth swing trade has happened
00:07:49.599 and it's actually broken this ladder
00:07:51.199 point so then you take your profit this
00:07:53.440 comes back to some kind of midway point
00:07:55.199 and then this is where you take your
00:07:56.400 position trade so you start to try to
00:07:58.080 use all these combining factors after
00:08:00.400 multiple swing trades have happened
00:08:02.000 after dozens and dozens and dozens of
00:08:04.160 scalps has happened
00:08:05.520 while this is at the bottom of the range
00:08:07.360 remember if we go to larger time frames
00:08:09.199 we wouldn't do this kind of approach
00:08:11.039 like this
00:08:12.400 we wouldn't do it in smack dab in the
00:08:14.160 middle of the range because there's just
00:08:15.360 too much movement up and down it can
00:08:16.639 have to turn into a position but in a
00:08:18.479 moment like this where you've got ladder
00:08:20.319 ladder ladder this refuses to jump it's
00:08:22.560 stabilizing over multiple four-hour
00:08:24.479 candles there's going to be a trade in
00:08:26.000 there that the longer you wait before it
00:08:28.400 moves up the closer you're getting to
00:08:30.479 that being a position trade either up or
00:08:33.039 down so i think that's a really smart
00:08:34.559 way to do it is is to wait until the
00:08:36.880 trades mature a bit but they sit in
00:08:38.640 accumulation for a little while or they
00:08:40.240 said in distribution like if it was just
00:08:41.760 kind of kind of constantly sitting up
00:08:43.360 here and just breaking ladders down and
00:08:45.040 just going like this and then like it
00:08:46.959 does it enough times one of those is
00:08:48.480 gonna end up being the position trade so
00:08:50.080 the longer you wait
00:08:51.839 the closer you get so with that
00:08:54.399 realization take a bunch of trades in
00:08:56.720 this range there's like 20 30 trades in
00:08:58.880 here that exist take a bunch of them and
00:09:00.640 then
00:09:02.160 if you miss it oh well there's the next
00:09:04.240 range you can play like if you miss the
00:09:05.920 position trade oh well no big deal
00:09:08.480 look it we just said we'd be out of this
00:09:09.839 trade because we think it's moving down
00:09:11.839 and it's moving down and we protected
00:09:13.279 our account instead of sitting there and
00:09:14.720 saying
00:09:15.600 um like oh oh my god we have to stay in
00:09:18.560 this trade it has to be inside of this
00:09:20.959 trade this is the moment that we have to
00:09:22.959 we have to stay in when we talked about
00:09:25.040 in the previous video being right here
00:09:26.880 in this trade and we moved up and we
00:09:28.640 lost the trade and we got out protecting
00:09:30.000 our profits
00:09:31.120 now
00:09:32.560 this trend is holding so you can get rid
00:09:34.720 of this trend here and we've got two
00:09:36.560 trends that are that are touching and
00:09:37.839 holding in the moment the next two
00:09:39.279 levels that we marked and it's happening
00:09:41.120 in the moment before your eyes giving
00:09:42.640 you the next perfect
00:09:44.480 scalp trait to enter or hopefully
00:09:46.720 anyways it moves up if you took your
00:09:48.160 trade there well looks like maybe not
00:09:49.920 maybe it's going after this deeper level
00:09:51.360 right here
00:09:53.040 wait for it wait for it
00:09:55.360 we're gonna hit it oh
00:09:58.000 did hit it right here
00:09:59.920 uh that counts as a test on the level so
00:10:01.600 don't expect it to go and test this
00:10:02.880 again a second time
00:10:04.560 you would still be in an okay position
00:10:05.920 here you could be exiting now to protect
00:10:07.760 your account if you enter too high if
00:10:09.200 you're a futures trader which would be a
00:10:10.880 pretty good strategy or you could just
00:10:12.560 be
00:10:13.440 hoping this holds so regardless of what
00:10:15.600 happens here you've got your kind of
00:10:17.279 perfect balances your first one happened
00:10:19.200 here your second one happened there and
00:10:21.120 this is the way you need to look at
00:10:22.560 position trades you need to realize
00:10:24.959 there's tons of trades that happen
00:10:26.640 beforehand and that you're you're only
00:10:29.279 ever going to
00:10:31.279 get into kind of these positions
00:10:33.360 where you're forfeiting money by always
00:10:35.440 turning something into a position trade
00:10:37.040 so that's uh that's a really good way to
00:10:38.959 look at scalp trades as your starting
00:10:40.880 point swing trades is a lot of mid-tier
00:10:42.800 points and then a position trade which
00:10:44.480 is like the ultimate position if you ask
00:10:46.240 me just like who you said before just
00:10:47.920 sitting there and letting the money grow
00:10:49.279 and uh what you have to start thinking
00:10:51.200 about when you take these trades and to
00:10:53.600 say okay a swing can develop into a
00:10:55.760 position and you can't have a swing
00:10:57.200 before you have a scalp so you have to
00:10:58.880 start at the bottom of the chain to
00:11:00.000 create the criteria that can allow the
00:11:02.240 trade to evolve into the proper trade
00:11:05.360 the right trade for the right moment
00:11:06.800 therefore maximizing profits all right
00:11:08.640 we'll see you on the next one

# Day Trade Strategy Series 11 Trend Breaks
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/E_b5kSQ0Tec

00:00:00.160 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:01.920 videos we look at quick ways to analyze
00:00:03.600 the markets and in this video we're
00:00:05.040 going to be talking about what to do
00:00:06.240 when a trend breaks
00:00:08.080 so first off i hope you're in your
00:00:09.760 position trade on this one because it
00:00:11.440 hit the perfect moment just from the
00:00:12.880 last video no kidding completely
00:00:14.559 obviously you won't be in this trade
00:00:15.759 you're not here with me but if you were
00:00:17.600 i want to see a trade so let's talk
00:00:19.840 about trend breaks this is a very common
00:00:22.960 thing that happens where you have a
00:00:24.320 trend it goes it tries to break it
00:00:26.720 people start shorting like crazy and
00:00:28.400 then the trend completely rips the other
00:00:30.320 direction this is because trends aren't
00:00:32.800 hard closing so what happens with trends
00:00:35.280 is this there's a lot happening a trend
00:00:37.120 is not
00:00:38.079 infinite it exists and it adapts and it
00:00:40.719 constantly is evolving in the criteria
00:00:43.200 in the moment it's constantly evolving
00:00:45.039 and showing you hey i just broke this
00:00:47.280 five minute level i'm gonna adapt the
00:00:49.760 trend to the three minute level and then
00:00:50.879 it breaks the three minute level goes
00:00:52.000 down to the one minute level and it
00:00:53.280 keeps decycling itself until it hits a
00:00:54.960 one minute level and then the one minute
00:00:56.239 level heart closes and it completely
00:00:57.920 explodes so these trends are always
00:01:00.000 evolving and if you were to take a short
00:01:01.600 at this trend because you thought it was
00:01:03.199 breaking down this is a common
00:01:04.959 occurrence man this is so common
00:01:07.439 anything can hold this trend up
00:01:09.840 anything in the world can be a ladder
00:01:12.320 point it can be there's a whole level
00:01:13.760 there's a reverse level there's all this
00:01:15.360 criteria for this reason we never
00:01:18.080 actively open new trades at trends
00:01:20.960 rather when a trend breaks you take the
00:01:24.799 level that's protecting the trend as
00:01:27.280 your target so an example of that would
00:01:30.079 be going back to the one hour time frame
00:01:32.240 here earlier in the day if you thought
00:01:34.400 this trend wasn't gonna hold you would
00:01:36.479 take the attack of that trend by buying
00:01:38.720 this level and shorting this hourly
00:01:40.799 inverse level here this hourly inverse
00:01:42.640 hold level
00:01:43.680 you would be saying i'm attacking the
00:01:45.439 trend below by taking this short
00:01:49.680 alternatively if you were to take a
00:01:51.360 short in the moment here
00:01:53.439 how often does a trade do something like
00:01:55.280 this where it breaks under it breaks
00:01:57.040 under and then it rips over top of it if
00:01:59.280 this thing keeps laddering right now
00:02:00.960 well guess what let's just draw a trend
00:02:02.960 and see where we're at with this thing
00:02:04.479 so we've got
00:02:06.000 this
00:02:07.200 this right here maybe it's gonna hold
00:02:09.199 this maybe there's a different time
00:02:10.318 frame here that's in play right now like
00:02:11.920 this to uh this one maybe you've got
00:02:14.000 this trend in play right now and you're
00:02:15.680 gonna hold that same level again and
00:02:17.760 you're gonna rip right over top of trend
00:02:19.520 when this thing breaks up if it decides
00:02:21.200 to break up it's such a common
00:02:23.200 occurrence and you can never play trends
00:02:25.680 like this for that reason you always
00:02:26.959 have to play them from the whole level
00:02:28.400 on another spot
00:02:31.040 the best way to play trends is if you
00:02:33.120 were in a long position from say down
00:02:36.160 here
00:02:36.959 right you have a long rate here because
00:02:38.879 you caught the very bottom of the move
00:02:40.400 once this trend breaks that acts as a
00:02:42.640 trigger point or a release to your trade
00:02:45.280 the way we use trends in trading is to
00:02:47.440 not buy them for breakout moments
00:02:49.599 because when a trend is breaking there's
00:02:51.440 a lot of levels that can hold it so if
00:02:53.040 you're buying trends for breakout
00:02:54.720 moments a lot of the times you're going
00:02:56.239 to suffer losses instead you should set
00:02:58.879 a criteria like if the one minute candle
00:03:00.959 hard closes this i'm out of the trade
00:03:03.040 and it acts as a as a mechanism to lock
00:03:05.680 up profits and protect your account from
00:03:07.840 a big dump instead of a mechanism to
00:03:10.560 enter a new trade because it's a really
00:03:12.640 high risk position to just enter a trade
00:03:14.720 on a trend break like right now i'm not
00:03:17.040 sure what's going to happen with this
00:03:18.000 move but let's pretend this is going to
00:03:20.480 break so we just bought a short and
00:03:22.159 let's see if this thing shorts you're
00:03:23.599 kind of sitting here with your fingers
00:03:24.959 crossed and you're just like oh man this
00:03:26.560 thing's breaking down i hope
00:03:28.400 i'm praying this thing breaks down but
00:03:30.480 you know right now it's kind of
00:03:31.680 laddering its move it hasn't hard closed
00:03:34.239 this trend yet
00:03:35.680 and then who's to say it doesn't have
00:03:37.519 another trend that it's gonna try to
00:03:38.959 respect like this who's to say it's not
00:03:41.440 gonna
00:03:42.239 hit that so again pretend like we're in
00:03:44.400 a short and all of a sudden it starts
00:03:45.680 regaining its level and now you're in
00:03:47.280 negative profits
00:03:48.799 what do you do
00:03:50.239 well it could still break down what if
00:03:51.920 it hits this inverse level and goes down
00:03:53.519 are you just going to hold it and lose
00:03:54.720 money as it recovers right so for this
00:03:57.120 reason you can never play trends because
00:03:58.959 they are way too risky instead what you
00:04:01.680 do is you have your trend and you use it
00:04:04.080 as a mechanism to release you from a
00:04:06.000 trade you're already in so trends can
00:04:08.480 only ever act as trigger points to
00:04:10.560 trades they can only ever act as hey
00:04:13.760 here's a trend
00:04:15.120 i'm in a trade already if it hard closes
00:04:17.519 this fits my criteria to get out of my
00:04:20.399 trade
00:04:21.440 and you've set up the perfect scenario
00:04:23.280 against trend trend breaks you're in
00:04:24.960 profits you're not willing to take
00:04:26.639 losses and training that is the number
00:04:28.080 one thing protect your account protect
00:04:29.759 your capital set mechanisms and
00:04:31.840 different criterias for triggers on your
00:04:34.479 trade therefore i call trends trigger
00:04:36.320 points because of reasons like this how
00:04:38.560 many times do you buy a trend breakout
00:04:40.800 and it's like oh man look at this thing
00:04:42.880 is now holding and we're moving up like
00:04:45.040 i told you this can just simply ladder
00:04:47.520 its move from back here because the
00:04:49.199 trend was never broken even going back
00:04:51.280 to this five minute here forget this one
00:04:53.360 this was never hard closed so the bigger
00:04:55.040 trend is still in play and then go to
00:04:56.800 your 15 minute trend which is this guy
00:04:58.800 well this guy is just recovering and how
00:05:01.120 often well i guess it would be an hourly
00:05:02.960 here um yeah it would be an hourly and
00:05:05.440 how often does this happen when you're
00:05:06.800 in a trade and now what if it dumps you
00:05:08.479 just left your you just left your short
00:05:10.800 you took losses and now it's gonna dump
00:05:13.280 and it's just like you're just
00:05:14.560 compounding losses on top of losses on
00:05:16.320 top of losses so you never ever ever
00:05:19.039 play trend breaks as new positions
00:05:21.520 rather set a mechanism set a criteria
00:05:24.479 one
00:05:25.280 when you're in a trade to say if this
00:05:27.120 heart closes or if we lose this trend i
00:05:29.520 am actually out of a spot that i'm
00:05:30.960 already in profits on easier said than
00:05:32.880 done but the trick here is to never ever
00:05:35.520 ever buy trend breakouts and if you're
00:05:37.520 going to
00:05:38.400 you buy them at the levels of inversion
00:05:40.160 even right now on this chart if you
00:05:41.840 think this is going to break down
00:05:44.160 go find the trail of levels that it's
00:05:46.080 hitting and buy that level instead so we
00:05:48.479 know that the hourly already got hit
00:05:49.919 right this hour they already got tested
00:05:51.520 right there so let's move down in time
00:05:52.960 frame and see what we can find
00:05:54.880 here's the 15 minute level right here
00:05:57.840 okay that already got hit what about
00:05:59.680 this one here okay there's a 15 minute
00:06:01.199 level forget the hourly we already know
00:06:02.560 that's there this trend on top may
00:06:04.560 compress it let's find the greedier five
00:06:06.800 minute point inside of there what about
00:06:08.560 this one okay there's the five minute
00:06:10.160 point that never really got tested what
00:06:11.600 about a three minute so there's the five
00:06:13.680 minute rate there which also kind of
00:06:15.440 coincides with a three minute so this is
00:06:17.039 starting to look like it's kind of a
00:06:18.160 smart spot if we want to play this trend
00:06:21.440 break so if we're going to say hey i
00:06:23.280 want this trend to break don't ever
00:06:24.880 short the trend wait till it comes back
00:06:26.560 to the level of inversion and by that
00:06:28.240 level because if the trend is truly
00:06:29.600 going to break it's going to break off
00:06:30.720 an inverse level just like when you have
00:06:32.800 trends break up through levels they
00:06:34.400 usually get held up by some type of hold
00:06:36.240 level that continuously props to move up
00:06:38.000 and continuously helps it move up heck
00:06:40.240 if you were really impatient you could
00:06:42.000 even enter this one minute hold level
00:06:43.680 which i don't think would be very smart
00:06:45.120 but if you were really impatient you
00:06:46.800 could go after this one here i think
00:06:48.720 this one up top looks great i think this
00:06:50.479 looks like a nice spot to short if you
00:06:52.240 agree that the trend is gonna break
00:06:54.160 and that's it yeah i don't think this is
00:06:56.080 a good one i think you'll have a small
00:06:57.360 reaction but who knows maybe this is the
00:06:59.360 actual level look at that the one minute
00:07:00.880 candle might hold it down you've entered
00:07:02.319 a short now you can see
00:07:04.400 that if this move continues to go down
00:07:07.680 this is what could break the trend and
00:07:09.440 therefore you're never really going to
00:07:10.560 get into any losses attacking trends
00:07:12.240 because you're never actually going to
00:07:13.199 buy the trend instead you're going to be
00:07:14.960 buying the points that attack the trends
00:07:17.280 and you're already going to be in trades
00:07:18.800 on the other side
00:07:20.960 and when that trend breaks it releases
00:07:22.720 you as a mechanism of protection in your
00:07:25.199 trades so this is the way we do trends
00:07:27.919 this is the way we play trend breaks and
00:07:30.400 yeah long story short don't buy trend
00:07:32.880 breaks because you're gonna get yourself
00:07:34.080 into trouble with them see you on the
00:07:35.599 next video

# Day Trade Strategy Series 12 Combined Theories

00:00:00.560 welcome to my strategy series in these
00:00:02.399 videos we look for quick ways to analyze
00:00:04.240 the markets and in this video we're
00:00:05.600 going to be combining some of the
00:00:06.560 theories we've learned so far
00:00:08.480 so we've gone over quite a few things
00:00:09.840 here in the first 11 videos a lot of
00:00:11.840 quick ways to analyze these markets and
00:00:14.000 as you continue going on in these
00:00:15.759 markets and continuing to trade it's
00:00:17.840 always going to be better to combine
00:00:19.279 these theories into multiple things when
00:00:21.520 i'm looking at bigger time frames and
00:00:23.199 trends i'm saying hey this is a level
00:00:25.599 that makes sense it's the five minute
00:00:27.199 level that could hold the move down or
00:00:28.720 maybe even further up here like we
00:00:30.320 originally thought this is the three
00:00:32.000 minute level combined with the five
00:00:33.360 minute level it can hit a trend it will
00:00:35.760 continue the latter point of the move
00:00:37.440 you're starting to combine all these
00:00:39.040 things to give it more relative strength
00:00:41.520 and i think that's a really important
00:00:42.960 word we need to use here is the
00:00:44.800 relativity of strength and if you have
00:00:47.440 multiple things
00:00:49.280 holding up a move or holding down a move
00:00:51.199 well this is just more reasons that
00:00:52.960 shorts are going to come in or longs
00:00:54.640 will push through a move and you're
00:00:56.000 about to see it right here what happens
00:00:57.840 at this trend line
00:00:59.520 matched with this three and five minute
00:01:01.039 hole level you've got quite a few things
00:01:03.039 working together as well as a ladder
00:01:04.720 point because if it breaks this it's
00:01:06.400 gonna go up somewhere
00:01:07.920 maybe in this region and break this
00:01:09.360 ladder point starting to reverse the
00:01:11.280 move so if you actually break that part
00:01:13.680 of the of the trade here and you pull
00:01:16.080 through this level you're you're gonna
00:01:17.360 start breaking through that move and
00:01:18.880 here's a three-minute level i don't know
00:01:20.080 if there'd be much past this you've got
00:01:21.439 that five minute back there you've got
00:01:23.280 the three minute here and you've got the
00:01:24.880 three minute within the five minute and
00:01:26.400 um yeah i think you're kind of at your
00:01:28.159 final moments here if you're gonna break
00:01:29.840 this trend you're gonna do it because
00:01:31.600 this level won't hold so the dangerous
00:01:34.159 thing here is if you hit this level and
00:01:36.079 you start holding above this trend even
00:01:38.240 though you may look like you're going
00:01:39.520 down you're going to end up hitting some
00:01:41.040 hold level that props to move up and
00:01:42.479 then you're going to start crushing
00:01:43.600 through these upper ranges so you're
00:01:45.600 using all the things that we learned so
00:01:47.920 far and you're combining a lot of these
00:01:49.439 theories to find smarter moments that
00:01:52.079 have a higher amount of strength instead
00:01:54.159 of just
00:01:55.040 blindly marking moments on the chart and
00:01:56.719 saying hey here's a 15 minute level
00:01:58.560 let's mark it looks good let's continue
00:02:00.799 on right just here here's one right here
00:02:03.040 15 minute level yeah great yeah it's a
00:02:05.680 nice 15 minute level and a lot of times
00:02:07.520 this is going to hold the move back
00:02:08.878 however when you start combining all
00:02:10.560 these different theories you can really
00:02:12.319 start to get some strong cool and
00:02:13.920 interesting moments so everything that
00:02:15.840 we discussed just remember that you can
00:02:18.319 combine a lot of these theories
00:02:21.200 to make stronger better smarter
00:02:23.200 decisions and even in this moment here
00:02:25.599 you would have had your five minute
00:02:27.200 candle right here the three minute
00:02:28.879 inside of it and you can now start
00:02:30.319 developing criteria going forward so if
00:02:32.560 you were in a short here in this trade
00:02:34.800 you could say hey i hit my level i need
00:02:37.200 to let this hold the move because if we
00:02:39.280 we're in a short right now and if this
00:02:40.800 breaks well we've already tested the
00:02:42.560 levels above so you've got the three
00:02:43.760 minute test right here and you've got
00:02:45.120 what you can't go over so if you start
00:02:47.680 to go over this level and hard close it
00:02:49.440 guess what you're probably losing your
00:02:50.640 trend and your level and it gives you
00:02:52.239 another one of these great exit
00:02:53.599 criterias because you're at that final
00:02:55.440 moment where you've combined all these
00:02:57.120 little moments inside of the trade to
00:02:59.840 find the smarter spots so combining
00:03:02.239 these theories is critical to finding
00:03:04.080 relative strength in the markets it's
00:03:06.239 critical to finding the smarter spots
00:03:07.920 that a lot of traders won't see because
00:03:09.599 they just don't work with all these
00:03:11.599 multitudes of concepts and
00:03:13.840 to be quite frank this has been a very
00:03:16.000 light series there's hundreds of other
00:03:18.319 things going on in the charts and you
00:03:19.599 can go learn that in my courses my full
00:03:21.519 courses butterfly fact and future
00:03:23.120 training and blueprints and all those
00:03:24.319 things but just combining a few simple
00:03:26.319 theories in our first 11 or so videos
00:03:28.959 gave us a lot of really really smart
00:03:30.959 ways that we can enter trades and ways
00:03:32.879 that we can really protect our account
00:03:34.640 give us a better understanding of
00:03:36.319 scalping and swing trading and all these
00:03:38.720 different things all at once so i think
00:03:40.799 it's a really
00:03:41.920 great way to look at trading combine
00:03:43.760 your theories master these simple ones
00:03:46.239 and you're going to have a great
00:03:47.280 foundation just to quickly analyze the
00:03:49.440 markets and um
00:03:51.040 yeah really kick-start your day so i'll
00:03:53.280 see you on the next strategies video
